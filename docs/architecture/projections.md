# Projection Inventory

The config component uses snapshot contract `v3`. Timezone-clear events retain
an empty optional value for an explicit browser-default choice. Older snapshots
are rebuilt from EVT because they represented that choice as an absent value.

Projections are derived read models rebuilt from an event log. Most live in
memory. Optional providers can own disposable locally checkpointed indexes.
`ServerContentView` coordinates the client-readable models that derive from
`EVT`. It has one ordered `evt.>` consumer, one apply barrier, one failure and
readiness state, and one exact applied EVT sequence. Focused models remain
separate components behind that barrier.

`initializeCoreProjections` registers each top-level projector once with a
stable machine-readable key and a human display name. `NewChattoCore` installs
that registry into the core runtime. The registry contains seven projectors:
`server_content_view`, `notification_decisions`, `notifications`, `user_auth`,
`invitations`, `oauth_clients`, and `bot_webhooks`. Each registration also declares whether
that key is eligible for shared snapshots.

Core couples each projection pointer to its exact projector as one typed
`events.ProjectionHandle` from the independently versioned incubation module.
Focused content handles bind to the `ServerContentView` projector. Thus,
existing domain APIs keep narrow model types while all included state uses the
same wait and failure boundary. Chatto-specific keys, names, memory estimates,
diagnostics, and snapshot policy remain in the core registration layer. This
boundary follows [ADR-056](../adr/ADR-056-extractable-nats-event-sourcing-framework.md).

`ChattoCore.Run` starts one process-local ordered consumer for each registered
projector. `ServerContentView` and the five independent EVT projectors read
`EVT`. Notifications reads `NOTIFICATIONS`. Each projector owns its physical
filters, replay progress, failure state, and readiness. Chatto waits for all
seven registered projectors before it completes boot.

Writers wait for the relevant projector sequence before returning
read-your-writes. Projection-aware domain models keep the projector references
needed for those waits; the `ChattoCore` facade does not mirror every registered
projector.

`InvitationModel` derives a process-local 16-character invite-token lookup
index from the cold-replayed Invitation projection. The index contains no
additional durable facts or stored bearer values and is rebuilt whenever the
append-only projected invitation identity count changes.

`CallModel`, `AssetModel`, and `UserModel` own their projection reads for domain
logic and API adapters. Call state, assets, user profiles, and content keys are
components of `ServerContentView`. Authentication remains an independent,
cold-replayed projection. Call token access material binds the call ID and E2EE
key to one revalidated content-view generation. Active-call and asset API
mapping use detached component snapshots.

Room Timeline stores compact EVT references and small derived indexes. It does
not store complete timeline events or message bodies. `RoomTimelineReadModel`
authorizes and selects references against `ServerContentView`. It then uses
`RoomTimelineHydrator` to read the selected records from EVT outside the apply
barrier. The hydrator validates the stored identity and routing metadata before
it returns a payload. Mutable body references are checked again after the read.

The shared `events.StreamMessageReader` keeps copied opaque records in a
process-local cache with sliding idle expiry and byte-costed LRU eviction. The
default idle lifetime is 15 minutes and the default approximate byte limit is
256 MiB per server process. `core.evt_read_cache_idle_ttl` and
`core.evt_read_cache_max_bytes` change these values. A maximum of `-1` disables
the byte limit. Cache misses use bounded exact stream reads. Secure deletion
removes the affected local cache entries. An info log reports both effective
settings at startup. Debug logs report direct misses, batch hits and misses,
read durations, LRU evictions, expired entry counts, and cache clears. They do
not report subjects or payloads.

ConnectAPI does not read the component directly. `RoomModel` is the sole
production owner of the Room Directory, Room Group Layout, Room Timeline,
Threads, and Reactions component APIs. These components use the shared
content-view projector. Threads also derives channel-room and DM message-to-root
mappings and account-to-thread interaction relationships from message-post
facts. It also consumes room join, leave, and stored suspension facts to derive DM-received
relationships for the other participants at the time of each post. Threads
keeps only the existence of each relationship, not the facts that caused it,
because reads only ask whether a relationship exists. Its v3 snapshot contract
records DM membership; the schema fingerprint selects a new cache namespace
when this shape changes. The
RBAC component snapshot contract is v2 and retains decisions from the
`evt.rbac.dm` singleton lane. Membership, message, thread, reaction, asset, realtime, room-group OCC,
and sidebar-ordering paths use focused `RoomModel` operations instead of
projection fields on `ChattoCore`. Raw membership reads are named as explicit
membership so they remain distinct from policy-derived Universal-room access.
DM membership is fixed at creation: the Room Directory component ignores
`UserLeftRoom` for DM rooms. Account deletion still records DM leave facts,
which end the account's DM call participation, so deleted accounts stay DM
members in current and replayed state. Snapshot semantics v2 records this rule,
so v1 snapshots are rebuilt.

Any non-cancellation error from checkpoint or snapshot restore, consumer setup,
or event application moves the projector into its failed state before its run
loop returns. Readiness and provider status therefore cannot remain
healthy-looking after an incomplete startup.

Projection consumers use a five-minute inactivity cleanup threshold. Because
event application is synchronous and disk-backed commits can temporarily stop
the pull loop, a shorter broker threshold could delete a live consumer while
its projection is still applying a batch. On shutdown or failure, the projector
stops the pull subscription and attempts to delete its current ephemeral
consumer. The deletion request has an independent two-second timeout. If the
request fails or the process crashes, inactivity expiry remains the fallback.

Chatto configures names as `projection-<key>-<random>_<generation>` for core,
asset-processing, and search projectors. Each projector has a unique random
suffix; the SDK increments the generation when it replaces a consumer.
Consumer metadata fields `projection_name` and `projection_description` identify
the owner. These labels do not change snapshot keys or durable worker names.

The projector framework owns JetStream message handling and passes stable
stream sequence numbers into `Projection.Apply`. Projection implementations do
not inspect consumer sequence numbers or raw JetStream metadata. An optional
startup-batch capability groups only the replay through the target captured at
startup; live events continue through individual `Apply` calls.

The ordered replay lifecycle receives decoded application events through
`events.EventDecoder[E]`. Chatto's `evtstream.NewProjector` constructor
supplies the unchanged `evtv1.Event` protobuf decoder, while
`NewDecodedProjector`/`NewDecodedProjectionHandle` expose the envelope-neutral
construction path. Decode failures remain fatal at the stored record's stream
sequence and cannot advance readiness.

Projections that require event-envelope idempotency keep event-ID sets only
through the captured startup target. Clean histories then release those sets
and use the highest applied stream sequence as a constant-size steady-state
guard. If startup replay observes a duplicate ID, only that projection retains
its set and first-event-wins compatibility behaviour. Projection diagnostics
report both retained event-ID memory and whether compatibility mode is active.

The asset-processing runtime unit owns a private, non-snapshotted
`AssetProjection`. It uses the same canonical and legacy replay subjects as the
main core projection, reaches the queue delivery's stream sequence before
processing, and waits for terminal writes before acknowledging. It is not part
of the `ChattoCore` projector registry and does not run main-app boot mutations.

## Local checkpoint support

The projector framework also supports a projection-owned local checkpoint.
The checkpoint contract binds the derived state and its highest atomically
applied EVT sequence to a stable projection key, a projection contract ID, and
the current EVT stream incarnation and retained sequence bounds. Chatto
supplies the identity resolver; at restore time the projector invokes it with
the same fresh stream-info snapshot that supplies the sequence bounds, then
carries the result as an opaque value.

A valid checkpoint replays only the remaining EVT tail. Its global stream
cutoff may be newer than the last event matching the projection's current
filters; only a cutoff beyond the EVT stream tail is a future checkpoint.

A projection uses at most one restore authority: ADR-050 snapshots, a local
checkpoint, or neither. A projection without either starts empty and cold-replays
`EVT`. Missing, corrupt, incompatible, future, or retention-gapped checkpoints
are invalid; the projection may safely reset owned state or fail startup for
operator recovery. A successful individual `Apply` or startup batch must
atomically commit its derived changes and supplied final stream sequence.

The bundled search provider owns the first locally checkpointed projection. It
is registered by its runtime unit rather than by `ChattoCore`. It consumes only
message body, message posting, message retraction, room deletion, user DEK
generation, and user key shredding event families, and uses projector key
`message_search`.

During captured startup replay it commits up to 256 ordered events and the
final checkpoint in one Bleve transaction, including a smaller final batch;
once current, each relevant live event is committed immediately.
Its checkpoint contract starts with `bleve-message-index-v12-` and includes a
stable fingerprint of the configured language analyzer set, so changing that
set forces a cold EVT replay.

The index stores current decrypted message text plus its body-event revision and
message/room/author/filter metadata. Each message also indexes its thread root
ID; a root uses its own message ID. The state needed to apply a later edit or
posting event is a stored, non-indexed field in that same Bleve document; it is
not duplicated as one internal Bolt key per message. Candidate revisions must
match current core state before hydration, fencing provider catch-up races.
Attachment descriptions are not indexed or copied into this projection.
The index also derives unstored fields for complete HTTP(S) URLs, email
addresses, hostname suffixes, and address parts from each current body. These
fields are absent from the stored projection state and are replaced with the
body after an edit. Extraction makes no network request.

Message bodies use BM25 scoring over a language-neutral field plus the
operator-selected subset of all 22 complete language analyzers available in
the bundled Bleve version. Omitting `search_provider.languages` selects all
analyzers; an explicit empty list selects none of the language-specific fields.
The index also stores non-plaintext DEK event metadata required to decrypt
later EVT tail records after restart. Retraction, room deletion, and user key
shredding remove matching documents in the same committed batch. Bleve's normal
background merger reclaims obsolete segments; Chatto does not use Scorch's
manual `ForceMerge` operation as part of projection correctness or startup
readiness.

The directory is a privileged, disposable local cache excluded from Chatto
backups. A recognized Chatto checkpoint contract change for the same EVT
incarnation triggers automatic index replacement and cold replay. Unknown
contracts, corrupt checkpoints, invalid replay bounds, and unrelated directory
entries fail startup with an operator recovery link. The provider holds an
OS-backed Bolt lock in `.chatto-search.lock` across open, replacement, and close.
It syncs a `.chatto-search-rebuild` intent marker before deleting only Bleve's
`index_meta.json` and `store` entries. The next startup retries interrupted
replacement before opening the index. The configured directory and mount stay
in place. Unreadable indexes without a rebuild marker are never deleted.

## Snapshot support

`core.projection_snapshots` enables ADR-050 encrypted projection snapshots.
Every eligible projection owns one opaque, projection-scoped contract ID and
generation prefix. The contract covers serialized state, replay semantics,
consumed event families, and cutoff meaning. Each ID combines a manual semantic
token with a fingerprint of the codec's reachable protobuf schema, so a schema
change automatically starts a new contract namespace. Most contracts use
semantic token `v1`; Assets uses `v3`, user profile uses `v4`, and Room Timeline
uses `v9`.

Room Timeline `v9` retains a historical-import bit on each message reference.
Unread and room-activity reads omit these messages, while timeline reads keep
them visible. Slow Mode, thread interaction, notification, webhook, and live
delivery consumers also omit historical posting effects when they replay EVT.

The 0.5 internal protobuf package split changes full protobuf names and selects
new snapshot contract IDs. A server ignores older snapshots, cold-replays EVT,
and writes new snapshots. It does not rewrite stored EVT or runtime-state data.

Room Timeline `v3` keeps retraction tombstones authoritative when a legacy
writer appends a later body payload and retains that payload's sequence for
secure deletion. Version 0.4 replicas use the earlier projection behavior, so
the 0.4-to-0.5 release upgrade requires coordinated replacement of every Chatto
server replica rather than a rolling server deployment.

Room Timeline `v4` adds the current attachment-bearing-message index. `v5`
rebuilds a room-and-author latest-original-post index from retained timeline
entries so Slow Mode remains equivalent after restore. Echo rows are excluded;
edits and retractions do not erase the original successful-post timestamp.
`v6` retains call-started and call-ended facts as visible room timeline entries.
`v7` also retains Threading Mode changes as visible room timeline entries;
older snapshots omitted those rows and therefore cold-replay under the new
contract. Its current schema also stores active pinned-message associations by room.
Those associations reference canonical timeline messages instead of copying
message content; retraction removes the association during projection. The
current Room Timeline schema stores only compact timeline and body references.
Its schema fingerprint rejects the earlier `v7` payload-bearing schema.

The Room Timeline, Threads, and Reactions components of the Server Content
View and the Notification Decisions projection intern event IDs in one
process-wide event ID table (ADR-110). The table holds each event ID once for all of
them. They store `uint32` handles instead of ID strings. The table contains
no projection state, so projections with independent replay frontiers can
share it. The table keeps ID bytes in an append-only arena and
indexes them with pointer-free hash keys, so the garbage collector does not
scan them. Handles are process-local; snapshots store ID strings, and a
restore interns them again. The table has its own locks, because the components
apply and read under different locks. Its hash index has 64 shards with
separate locks, so concurrent lookups of different IDs rarely contend. A read
of an ID from a handle does not lock. The components and projections keep separate models, and only the
table is shared. A component or projection that is created outside the
production wiring, for example in a test, owns a private table.

The Notification Decisions Badge source index keeps one pointer-free record
per message post in a dense slice indexed by event ID handle. The records stay
after their sources expire, because later replies and reactions address them.
The index also holds explicit thread follow states, thread followers, and
thread reply counts with handle keys. User, room, and emoji IDs use a small
private table of the index.

The Room Timeline component shares room and user IDs between compact event
rows. Each row keeps a small event-kind value and its creation time in Unix
nanoseconds. Rows contain no Go pointers. Each row stores event ID handles for
its event, thread root, and echo source, and a flag marks thread replies. A
reply's containing thread is its thread root. A handle can name
an event that has not arrived or that is outside the timeline. A dense slice
indexed by event ID handle locates the row of an event, and the row locates
the message's current body state in a dense array. Body authors use the
shared user table. Only messages with multiple body events retain a separate
index of superseded body sequences. A small map holds body facts and body
history that arrive before their message post. The projection moves these
values into the dense and sparse indexes when the post arrives.

Threads interns user and room IDs in one small table. Its indexes store
`uint32` handles instead of ID strings. Each thread keeps its replies in one
pointer-free slice with the reply's author, time, and retraction state, and a
small map locates the thread of a reply. The cached thread summary counts
visible replies per author in first-reply order; the first authors form the
display preview. Follow state, thread followers, and followed threads use
handle keys. Reads of followers and followed threads sort them by ID, because
a restore does not keep the follow order. Room deletion removes the room's
message references and relationships. The message IDs of that room stay in
the shared event ID table.

Content Keys keeps each DEK epoch in one flat map keyed by user handle,
purpose, and epoch, with only the key references, the interned wrapping
algorithm, and the wrapping metadata. Reads return a new
`UserDEKGeneratedEvent`.

Reactions interns emoji, user, and room IDs in one table and message IDs in
the shared event ID table. It keeps the source event ID of each active
reaction as a string, because each source ID occurs only once. Each message
has a short slice of active reactions, sorted by emoji and user handles.

Timeline, Threads, and Reactions construct detached read results.

Compact records store times as Unix nanoseconds, where zero means "no time".
Room Timeline, Threads, Reactions, and Content Keys each keep their
restorable state in one value. A restore builds a new value and replaces the
complete state at once, so a failed restore leaves the state unchanged. An
empty snapshot restores an empty component; a cold replay of the content view
depends on this reset.

Snapshot loads and replay frontiers are projector-local. A successful restore
starts that projector's ordered consumer at one greater than its cutoff. A
missing, invalid, or unavailable scalar snapshot cold-replays only its owning
projector. A missing or invalid `ServerContentView` cohort cold-replays the
complete content view. Chatto does not combine restored and replayed content
components. Credential-bearing user state is owned by `UserAuthProjection` and
cold-replays from focused user event families.

The projector framework atomically captures a projection snapshot cohort and
its applied EVT sequence. Each component serializes its own explicit protobuf
state as one independent encrypted object. One encrypted manifest binds the
required component keys, contracts, object references, EVT stream identity,
and shared cutoff. The repository publishes one pointer only after all objects
are durable. It retains current and previous complete cohorts and uses KV
revision OCC for publication.

Room Timeline retains one body-state entry per message. It stores the current
body-event ID and EVT sequence, the author ID, the current attachment count,
and an active flag. The active flag and the attachment count share one
32-bit field. The body-event ID is in an append-only arena of the
component, so the entry contains no Go pointers. A sequence slice is allocated only after an edit. Its
component codec preserves the complete body-event sequence history. Complete
encrypted body payloads remain in EVT and are not part of the snapshot cohort.

Mentionables retains encrypted login source events and wrapped DEK records
rather than plaintext handles or lookup digests. The Users codec retains
encrypted login, display-name, and verified-email values, lookup digests,
wrapped DEK records, and non-secret profile metadata. Its schema has no fields
for password verifiers, authentication generations, external identity
subjects, or OAuth consent.

Every replica checks snapshot eligibility immediately after boot and hourly.
Each scheduled pass attempts the `MEMORY_CACHE` lease once; a winner runs jobs
sequentially and releases the lease before the hourly wait. The worker publishes
after cold or delta replay and refreshes unchanged generations once they reach
23 hours old. Repository OCC remains the correctness boundary for staggered or
stale writers.

S3 expiry uses a separate `MEMORY_CACHE` cooldown claim shared by all replicas.
The first elected pass after the cooldown expires runs bounded cleanup and keeps
the claim for 24 hours on success. Failures release it for an hourly retry.

Generations are compressed and authenticated with XChaCha20-Poly1305 under an
HKDF key derived from `core.secret_key`. Chatto stores them under the reserved
projection snapshot namespace in the dedicated NATS `PROJECTION_SNAPSHOTS`
Object Store or the configured S3 bucket. Encrypted current and previous
pointers live in `RUNTIME_STATE` and use KV revision OCC for both payload
backends. The opaque pointer locator is scoped by projector and contract.

A new secret uses a different generation epoch and pointer locator. EVT carries
a versioned opaque incarnation ID so snapshot validation survives process
reconstruction and backup restore but changes when EVT is recreated.
`internal/evtstream` owns Chatto's metadata key, format, generation, and
validation. Core composition passes its resolver into projector restore
configuration. The projector binds the resolved value to its run and captures
it with snapshot state and cutoff.

Capture checks the current incarnation immediately before and after the
projection barrier, performs no NATS I/O while holding that barrier, and
refuses publication if the identity differs. The worker publishes the captured
value. A transient lookup failure during best-effort restore falls back to the
identity validated at configuration, so publication can recover after cold
replay without accepting an actual stream recreation. Persistence mechanics
treat the identity as opaque.

`core.projection_snapshot_retention` defaults to seven days. NATS applies it as
the Object Store TTL. S3 uses a bounded age-expiry pass after daily publication
unless `core.projection_snapshot_s3_cleanup` is disabled for an external
lifecycle policy. S3 deletion requires the exact generation-key grammar,
expected snapshot content type, and private object-purpose marker. Snapshot and
expiry failures are logged and never affect core readiness or EVT-backed
reconstruction. Legacy cohort paths remain outside application S3 expiry.

Registered projector keys are used by metrics and automation. Registered names
match the admin projection diagnostics. Composite projections expose nested
read models, but only their parent projector is started by `ChattoCore.Run`.
`chatto_projection_component_estimated_bytes` reports separate room-timeline,
threads, reactions, and shared event ID table (`event_ids`) estimates inside
the Server Content View. The component estimates and the Notification
Decisions estimate do not include the shared table. These estimates are
diagnostic approximations; retained-heap benchmarks measure their actual Go
heap cost. `BenchmarkProjectionRetainedHeapFromStore` replays the `EVT` stream
of a copied NATS data directory from `CHATTO_BENCH_EVT_STORE_DIR` to measure
the cost with real event mixes.

Independent projectors isolate snapshot availability, replay cost, status,
lag, failure, and read-your-writes waiters for state outside the content view.
`ServerContentView.Subjects()` declares `evt.>` as its readiness contract.
Each component has a focused subject declaration. The componentized projection
prepares an EVT record only for matching components. The projector advances
the shared sequence after all matching component mutations commit.

Permission resolution and permission explanation run inside one
`ServerContentView` read transaction. Account state, bot ownership, room
metadata, membership, suspensions, Room Group placement, and RBAC state therefore
come from one applied EVT generation. Request-time authorization still uses
the subject-tail validation and aggregate OCC procedure from ADR-087.

`AssetModel` is the sole production reader of every asset-derived index and
uses content-view readiness. Cross-package callers receive a detached
`AssetState` containing declaration, room, processing, deletion, and burn state from
one projection generation. Explicit asset attachments establish immutable
message, room, and author ownership; message-body facts supply an uploader-
matched first-reference fallback for older histories plus public link-preview
references. Room Timeline retains only timeline rendering, body lifecycle,
tombstone, echo, and current room-file indexes; it does not duplicate asset
lifecycle state or complete message-body payloads. Message-body writers use the
one content-view wait before they return.

Burn state survives tombstones so replay and encrypted snapshots preserve
consumed sessions and per-sender/per-room permanence acknowledgements. Normal
metadata reads expose no burn URLs. Binary access first catches the local asset
projection up to that asset's authoritative tail, including all derivative
ancestors, before evaluating the account-bound session and fixed deadline.

`UserProjection` retains encrypted user fields and their AAD metadata. The user
and mentionable components decrypt login and email values during mutation
preparation. They commit in-memory lookup changes only after all matching
components prepare successfully. Neither plaintext nor the digests are
persisted in `EVT`. Read hydration decrypts profile PII with
request-scoped DEK reuse. KMS and decryption failures remain operational errors
rather than appearing as missing or deleted users.
Admin list reads use detached lifecycle and creation metadata before row
hydration. Timestamp-ordered accounts do not require profile decryption for an
empty search. Legacy accounts without timestamps still read their login to
preserve sort order. This read view adds no persisted projection state.
The projection also retains the event ID of the primary verified email. The
first verified-email event supplies the default. A later primary-email event
changes the selection by referencing an existing verified-email event, without
copying the email address.
`UserAuthProjection` is independently locked, registered, and replay-guarded.
`UserModel` reads profile state from `UserProjection` and credential,
external-identity, consent, and auth-generation state from
`UserAuthProjection`, giving domain callers one user boundary while snapshot
serialization cannot reach authentication state.

Bot account kind and owner ID are durable user-aggregate fields projected by
`UserProjection`; it also maintains the current owner-to-bot index used for
management, reassignment, and cascade deletion. `UserAuthProjection` replays
the active bot API-key IDs, names, verifiers, and creation times from EVT.
Historical create and rotation events without key metadata project as the
synthetic `legacy` default key. A historical rotation replaces every active
verifier during replay. Current commands do not write replace-all rotations.
A revocation removes only the selected verifier. When either fact takes effect,
the projection closes process-local realtime watchers that used a removed
verifier. A rollback-visible key uses a rotation-shaped revocation fence so an
older binary cannot restore the raw revoked key after rollback. The projection
also replays the active incoming webhook IDs, names, verifiers, and creation
times. A
historical verifier-replacement fact from the unreleased
implementation replaces only the selected verifier during replay. Current
commands do not write this fact. Revocation removes only the selected webhook.
A webhook fact from the first unreleased implementation has no ID and projects
to the synthetic `legacy` ID.
The raw API key and incoming webhook credential are never projection values,
snapshot fields, or retrievable resources.

## Bot webhook projection

[`botWebhookProjection`](../../cli/internal/core/bot_webhook_projection.go)
uses cold EVT replay. It retains encrypted endpoint configuration and activation
sequences. It consumes configuration, updates, revocations, and account deletion.
Pause/resume advances the cutoff without changing the credential encryption
context. A configuration edit replaces the encrypted settings for the same
endpoint ID and advances the cutoff, but preserves the first creation time.
Failure history and latest-failure summaries are read directly from LOG; they
are not projection values and disappear when their records expire.

### Echo content references

Room Timeline resolves each visible echo to an original thread reply in the
same room. Body selection and attachment indexes use the original body
reference. Echo bodies from historical EVT records remain indexed only for
physical record ownership and secure deletion. Snapshot restore rebuilds
attachment membership from these links. The Room Timeline snapshot semantics
token is `v9`. Timeline pages batch original metadata reads and reuse metadata
and canonical bodies within the response. Missing or invalid original metadata
is omitted for the affected echo; storage errors still fail the read. Historical
echo metadata is never used as a fallback. Projections do not retain decrypted
content.

The Bleve search checkpoint contract is `bleve-message-index-v12`. Echo posts
are not searchable contributions. Historical echo bodies cannot replace the
original search document or create a second result.
