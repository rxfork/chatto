# Interface Inventory

The internal [`@chatto/client`](../../packages/chatto-client/README.md) package
is the Chatto client. The bundled frontend, ChattoBot, and the local Runling
bot use it. It owns the ConnectRPC facades, sessions, the realtime transport
and projection, the server data, and the Store boundary events. It does not
add server endpoints or depend on Runling or a UI framework. Hosts retain
their UI state, credential loading, webhook handling, and conversation state;
see [ADR-111](../adr/ADR-111-move-client-state-into-chatto-client.md).

The client also owns what bots need: servers with fixed API keys, an
ordered message loop with a context per addressed message, message splitting,
thread history, reactions, typing refresh, addressing recognition, reply
context, conversation keys, and accepted-delivery tracking. It has no Runling
dependency. ChattoBot retains routing, inboxes, cancellation, and
configuration reload state.

The official mobile client uses the built-in OAuth identity `eu.chattocorp.chatto.mobile`
and exact callback `eu.chattocorp.chatto.mobile:/oauth/callback`. System authentication
returns the callback to the client; token exchange and bearer-authenticated
API requests use the existing HTTP interfaces. Older servers without this
registration cannot complete mobile sign-in. See
[ADR-099](../adr/ADR-099-capacitor-mobile-client.md).

This inventory records mounted transport and service boundaries. The generated
[ConnectRPC API reference](../../apps/docs-website/src/content/docs/reference/connectrpc-api/index.mdx)
is authoritative for individual RPCs, request and response messages, and public
method documentation.

[ADR-084](../adr/ADR-084-separate-internal-protobufs-by-storage-contract.md), and
[ADR-085](../adr/ADR-085-agent-integration-through-mcp.md).

`MyAccountService.SetCustomStatus` replaces the complete custom status through
the existing core status command. All public resource `Update*` requests use
field masks under [ADR-044](../adr/ADR-044-connectrpc-service-conventions.md).
The Connect interceptor removes unselected values before protobuf validation;
direct handlers use the same normalization and validation. Selected absent
values reset, subject to domain rules. The core receives sparse selected inputs
and owns authorization and concurrency. Profile fields and any login cooldown
fact append in one atomic batch of existing EVT events.

## Transport boundaries

The server recognizes the official mobile OAuth client
`eu.chattocorp.chatto.mobile` with the exact callback
`eu.chattocorp.chatto.mobile:/oauth/callback`. This built-in registration needs
no operator configuration. It uses the existing authorization and token
endpoints, client policy, consent, and PKCE checks. No public or persisted
protobuf schema changes are required. See
[FDR-023](../fdr/FDR-023-authentication-and-sessions.md).

When `auth.loopback_client_enabled` is set, the server also recognizes the
built-in loopback browser client `chatto://loopback`. It accepts the callback
`/servers/callback?mode=popup` on each HTTP or HTTPS loopback origin, with any
port. The bundled frontend uses this identity when it runs on a loopback origin
and signs in to a server that is not local, because that server cannot retrieve
a CIMD document from the frontend origin. Sessions of this client have a fixed
window of at most 24 hours.

The public HTTP edge mounts every handler returned by `connectapi.API.Handlers`.
Authenticated services are wrapped with `connectrpc.com/authn` before protobuf
decoding and validation. `ExternalIdentityAuthService`,
`PushSubscriptionCleanupService`, `ServerSetupService`, `ServerDiscoveryService`, and reflection are
public; all other public-listener services require an authenticated user. The Operator API uses
`connectapi.API.OperatorHandlers` and is mounted only on the configured Unix
socket.

`MyAccountService.GetPresencePreference` and `SetPresencePreference` read and
change the caller's private availability across devices. `RefreshPresence`
refreshes liveness without changing this choice. Legacy `SetPresence` cannot
override a saved choice.

`MyAccountService.GetSettings` exposes caller-owned display preferences using
the same settings resource as updates and the combined viewer response.
`MyAccountService.SetDMVisibility` sets one private conversation visibility
choice for the caller. The caller must be a DM member. The server saves the
choice across clients. `RoomService.StartDM` restores an existing conversation
for the caller. `ViewerPreferencesChanged` tells that account's clients to read
its settings again. Other accounts do not receive the preference event.
When `email.disabled` is true, public discovery sets
`ServerLogin.email_disabled`. Direct registration completion accepts a username
and password without a token and uses the existing atomic account/invitation
batch. Legacy email registration, verification, and recovery routes reject
requests. The account email RPCs reject requests as well. No email sender is
initialized. The normal password and owner-role APIs remain in use.

`MyAccountService` also lists the caller's verified emails, sends and confirms
email-verification codes, and selects the primary email. These methods do not
accept a caller-selected target account. They require the caller's expected
account ID as a stale-session assertion and reject a different authenticated
account before reading or changing email state. Verification delivery uses the
server's configured transactional email sender.

`MessageService` and `ThreadService` expose complete, paginated reaction-user
and reply-author references in addition to bounded message previews.
`MessageService.UpdateMessage` permits an author or a user with effective
`message.manage` to remove a thread reply's channel echo. Enabling an echo
remains author-only and requires `message.echo` and `message.post`. Clients omit
unchanged echo state. Removal uses the existing atomic room edit and retraction.
Hydrated messages include optional `viewer_state.can_reply_in_thread` authority
for their canonical thread, including roots without an established thread.
The shared posting check combines membership, room policy,
read access, and broad or interaction-scoped write authority. The write model
repeats this check inside the room aggregate's OCC attempt. Interaction posting
uses the existing thread projection; it adds no durable events or runtime keys.
`MessageService.CreateMessage` accepts attachment descriptions keyed by an asset
ID in the same request. `MessageService.SetAttachmentDescription` replaces or
clears one current description with message-edit authorization. Hydrated message
attachments and room-file wrappers expose the description; the base `Asset`
resource remains description-free.
`RoomService` and `ThreadService` expose caller-owned read markers through
singular and bounded batch reads. These reads use existing message-read
authorization and do not initialize or advance markers.

`AdminInviteLinkService` requires `user.invite`. Its resource includes the
full, deterministically reconstructed invite link so authorised operators can
copy it again; raw bearer tokens are not stored in `EVT`. Opening
`/invite/{token}` validates the compact capability, stores only the invitation
ID in the signed browser session, and immediately redirects to registration.

`AdminServerService` provides CRUD operations for Neighbor resources. These
methods require `server.manage-neighbors`. `ServerDiscoveryService.ListNeighbors`
returns canonical origins without a session or an ordering contract. Neighbor
writes do not contact the advertised origins.
`ServerDiscoveryService.ListNeighborhoodServers` returns the cached result of
background Neighborhood discovery without a session. The call reads
`neighborhood.directory` from `MEMORY_CACHE` and never contacts another server.
Its logo and banner URLs are server-relative `/assets/neighborhood/{sha256}`
paths.
See [ADR-106](../adr/ADR-106-server-side-neighborhood-discovery.md).

Public `User` resources expose `bot: BotInfo` for active bots in ordinary
reads, administrator lists, and realtime snapshot hydration. The bot profile
refreshes this reference every 30 seconds and loads the owner's public identity
through `UserService.BatchGetUsers`. No credentials or management rights are
exposed by the reference.

`UserService` provides user reads and the canonical target-aware operations
that update profiles and upload or delete avatars. Self-targeting is available
to human and bot callers. A cross-human target requires
`user.manage-accounts`. A cross-bot target permits
the bot owner, `user.manage-accounts`, or `bot.manage`. A bot cannot target
another account. These operations validate stable request-time authorization
inputs, use OCC on the target user aggregate, and then return the ready user
projection.

`AdminPermissionService` uses the same scope pagination for role/user matrix
and decision reads. The core selects at most 100 scopes before cell evaluation
and loads parent-group rules independently of the page. Scope enumeration still
scans the directory. Bot reads filter room visibility before pagination and
counts. See [permission scope selection](../../cli/internal/core/permission_scope_page.go).

`RoomService.ListMembers` returns active membership IDs in stable ID order.
An empty search reads lifecycle and membership metadata without profile
decryption. Name searches hydrate profiles to match login and display name.
An optional presence-status filter uses the shared watcher snapshot before
pagination. Counts describe the filtered set. It does not read per-user KV keys.
`UserService.BatchGetUsers` assembles requested profiles with bounded concurrency
and one request-scoped encryption-key cache. See
[FDR-025](../fdr/FDR-025-user-search-and-member-directory.md).

`AdminUserService.ListMembers` returns ordered IDs and page metadata. Empty
searches read lifecycle and creation metadata; only legacy accounts without a
creation time need login hydration for sorting. Name searches read profiles.
`BatchGetMembers` checks admin access again, returns private rows and role
summaries, and reads presence once from the shared watcher. Singular reads and
mutation responses retain their KV-backed presence reads. The frontend caches
rows and their role summaries together under server/session-scoped admin query
keys. Permission loss, logout, and account deletion cancel older reads and clear
private snapshots. Pagination advances by returned IDs, not hydrated rows.

`AdminRoleService` separates role details from explicit membership pages.
Its `ListMembers` gates each request with `role.assign`; it selects assignment IDs
before bounded user-profile hydration. It does not require `admin.view-users`.
See [role operations](../../cli/internal/core/role_management.go) and the
[role member assembler](../../cli/internal/connectapi/role_member_assembler.go).

`BotService` exposes bot lifecycle, administrator-initiated owner reassignment,
and create and revoke operations for as many as 20 named API keys and 20 named
incoming webhooks for each bot. Bot permission configuration reads and writes
use `AdminPermissionService`'s canonical user permission operations with the
bot's user ID as the target. Human owners can
manage their own bots; `bot.manage` allows global management. A human with
`user.manage-accounts` can list and read all bots for profile and avatar
administration, but this visibility does not grant bot credential, permission,
ownership, or lifecycle authority. Bot reads include the start of the bot's
username cooldown from the user projection.

`chatto.api.v1.PermissionService.ListEffectivePermissions` is a read-only,
complete effective permission read without pagination or truncation. Authenticated members can inspect
bot targets; human targets require `user.manage-permissions`. Core evaluates
the existing resolver in one server content view, including bot owner limits.
The response retains inherited and included grants. Child coverage metadata
accounts for hidden rooms before room identities are filtered. The client
combines grants for display. Stored overrides and inactive grants remain in
the existing admin matrix API, with its management checks. Neither effective
permission scopes nor their coverage metadata expose individual DM participants.

Owner reassignment validates stable request-time authorization inputs and uses
user-family OCC. This boundary serializes reassignment with deletion of the bot
or either human owner.

`RoomDirectoryService.ListRooms` intersects the room-kind scope with an archive
filter. The default returns active rooms; callers can select archived rooms or
both states. The read uses the existing room catalog, visibility checks, and
canonical room response. It filters room identities before pagination, orders
them by ID, and hydrates viewer state only for the selected page. Archive discovery does not change membership or
permissions. Room-group and realtime navigation snapshots keep their default
active-room scope.

`RoomService.AddMember` and `RemoveMember` accept room managers, account
managers, bot owners, and human bot managers. `room.manage` for the room or
`user.manage-accounts` overrides the target account's missing `room.join`.
Without either override, a bot manager needs the bot's effective `room.join`,
including its owner's ceiling. Suspensions and archived rooms prevent adding.
Removal does not require join permission and works in archived rooms.
Both operations recheck authorization within room aggregate OCC retries and
reuse the existing membership and audit events. Neither changes grants.
`RoomMemberAdded` and `RoomMemberRemoved` identify the acting manager in
`actor_id` and the target account in their payload. Each audit record commits
atomically with its membership transition, including permission overrides.

`RoomService.GetMember` and `BatchGetMembers` read the requested accounts'
effective membership, including universal membership. Account managers can
read channel membership without joining. Bot managers can read only their
target bots through this additional gate; they cannot list other members.
DM reads still require caller membership. The account permission matrix UI
composes these reads with `RoomDirectoryService.BatchGetRooms`; membership is
not part of the permission API. Client reads use batches of at most 100 rooms
and at most six concurrent member lookups.

Matrix room metadata is limited to rooms visible to both the bot owner and the
managing caller; group metadata follows the room directory's complete group
layout so empty groups remain configurable. Each bot API key authenticates the
normal public and realtime surfaces, but cannot call bot-management or human
account-security operations. Reassignment requires `bot.manage`, preserves the
active keys and configured allowlist, and immediately changes the owner
permission ceiling.

API-key creation returns the raw key once. Safe metadata includes its stable
ID, manager-defined name, creation time, and best-effort last-use telemetry.
Revocation closes only established realtime connections that used the selected
key.
Incoming webhook creation returns the complete URL once. The frontend can add
the selected destination as a `room_id` query parameter. This does not change
the credential scope or store a default room. A manager replaces a
webhook when the manager creates a new credential, moves the caller, and
revokes the old credential. Each webhook can be revoked without a change to
other webhooks. Safe metadata includes the creation time and best-effort
last-use telemetry. The separate credentials cannot authenticate ConnectRPC or
realtime requests.

`NotificationPolicyService` provides explicit server, room-group, and room
policy scopes. Its batch read accepts at most 100 scopes, removes duplicates in
first-seen order, and omits missing or inaccessible resource scopes.
`NotificationService` owns occurrence reads and triage only; policy reads and
writes use `NotificationPolicyService`.

`AdminDiagnosticsService.GetSystemInfo` is owner-only and includes
broker-derived status for Chatto's known durable worker queues. The additive
worker list is absent on older servers; clients must treat that as diagnostics
unavailable rather than as a healthy empty set.
JetStream account, stream/consumer, server-statistics, and projection telemetry
is independently optional. Message presence or the projection-availability flag
records whether collection succeeded, so one failure does not suppress unrelated
system diagnostics or turn unavailable metrics into healthy-looking zeroes.

The [synthetic data generator](../../cli/internal/core/seed_development.go) uses
existing account, channel, membership, and message operations. Its CLI is
`chatto operator seed`. It adds no event types, streams, or projections and waits
for serving projections before success. The
[test-only HTTP wrapper](../../cli/internal/http_server/seed_test_endpoint.go)
also mounts `POST /auth/test/seed` and `POST /auth/test/create-session` in
`test_endpoints` builds. Session creation accepts an existing human account ID
and returns a normal cookie session with CSRF state. The fixed
`/auth/test/seed-performance` fixture remains independent.

## Trusted NATS services

The `chatto.search.v1` provider contract defines normalized query and readiness
messages under `svc.chatto_ext.search.v1.>`. `search.Client` validates both
sides of request/reply, maps NATS micro error headers, and treats missing
responders or the bounded provider-call deadline as provider unavailability.
Compatible providers share a queue group for replica load balancing. Ready
status and queries use `.status` and `.query`; startup progress uses
`.status.startup` only as a fallback when no ready status responder exists.
The bundled provider joins both ready queues only after replay is current.

This is a trusted server-side integration surface, not a public client API.
Query responses contain thin message and room IDs. The public
`MessageSearchService` prefilters provider queries to the caller's complete
current member-room set. It then uses
`MessageSearchReadModel` and the normal timeline hydrator to recheck room
membership, current body availability, and message/room identity before
returning canonical `Message` resources. Public cursors encrypt and authenticate
the continuation and bind it to the viewer and complete public request.

`MessageSearchService.SearchMessages` accepts independent `FOLLOWED_THREADS`
scope and `THREAD` grouping. Message search retains its defaults. All modes
share parsing, structured filters, availability, and cursor sealing.
`MessageSearchReadModel` sends the complete followed-root set when requested.
For groups it validates matching body revisions, excludes resolved roots on
subsequent queries, and restarts the provider cursor when exclusions change.
This avoids scanning every matching reply. Provider pages contain at most 100
hits and the complete grouped operation has a 30-second deadline. Exact totals
and activity sorting require enumeration of all matching groups.
The model rechecks current follow state and access before group pagination.
Relevance and newest order use the best valid matching message; activity order
uses current thread metadata. Both modes return `MessageSearchResult`: a
matching message and score, plus `ThreadSearchContext` for grouped results.
The context reports actual viewer follow state. A root without replies is a group.
The sealed group cursor carries a distinct-thread offset; message cursors carry
the provider continuation. Neither pins a snapshot across pages.
Providers must acknowledge applied thread inclusion and exclusion filters;
older providers fail closed for unsupported filters. Thread filters do not
contribute to relevance scores.

The bundled provider runs under `chatto run` when
`search_provider.enabled = true`; the same unit runs standalone through
`chatto search-provider`. `search.enabled` independently controls whether the
public service accepts queries. `GetStatus` preserves disabled, indexing,
ready, degraded, and unavailable states without affecting other APIs. Exact
provider replay counts stay on the trusted NATS contract and in operator logs;
the authenticated public status does not expose server-wide event-log scale.

`ServerDiscoveryService.GetServer`, `ListNeighbors`, and
`ListNeighborhoodServers` support side-effect-free GET. They also receive wildcard public CORS and conditional-response caching.
Other bundled-client Connect traffic uses POST.

The discovery response includes the server software version as public
pre-authentication state, along with configured provider metadata and the
independently configured direct-registration and direct-login capabilities.
The direct-login capability uses scalar presence so a new client treats an
older server that omits it as enabled. The bundled client refreshes discovery
per server and owns one minimum supported server version. It does not gate
individual features by server version. The 0.5 client requires a server at
`0.5.0-beta.9` or newer before opening realtime protocol 4, the only accepted
behavioral version. The
`chatto.realtime.v1` suffix remains the protobuf namespace.

Public server discovery includes each OIDC provider's issuer for clients that
need to identify or present configured login options. Authling has no special
frontend trust path: a Chatto server uses it only when the operator configures
it as an ordinary OIDC provider.

OIDC provider login selects token authentication before one code exchange.
`token_endpoint_auth_method` overrides discovery; otherwise confidential
clients prefer advertised Basic, then POST, with Basic as the default only
when metadata omits the methods field. Public clients send their ID in the
request body. Current and legacy callback routes share this behavior and PKCE.
Missing names or a missing requested email trigger UserInfo. Its subject must
match the verified ID token before missing fields are filled. Email and its
verification flag come from the same response. Unavailable or malformed
UserInfo leaves ID-token claims intact. Token-exchange diagnostics record only
provider ID, authentication method, status, and allow-listed OAuth error codes.
The verifier's key-fetch transport removes unsupported JWK types and curves
from mixed key sets, with a 1 MiB response limit. Supported keys still use the
OIDC library's validation, signature verification, and rotating-key cache.

`MessageSearchService.GetStatus` remains the authority for configured search
availability and transient provider readiness. Viewer permissions remain the
authority for authenticated feature access.

Absolute URLs in API responses use the public origin of the request. When the
request host matches `webserver.url` or an exact `webserver.allowed_origins`
entry, that configured origin applies. Other hosts get `webserver.url`. Without
it, the HTTP edge uses only the direct request TLS state and host. The HTTP
edge does not trust forwarded protocol headers. `webserver.trusted_proxies`
controls client IP attribution and realtime same-origin comparison. It does not
control public URLs. Core returns server-relative asset URLs. The API layer makes
them absolute for each request, so asset URLs use the same origin as the other
URLs in the response. Without `webserver.url`, attachment and link-preview URLs
stay server-relative. Call participant metadata always uses the `webserver.url`
origin because other participants read it.

Chatto-streamed protected attachments are sequential full responses. They
advertise `Accept-Ranges: none` and ignore `Range`, returning `200` with the
complete object. NATS-backed video is therefore not seekable. Passive S3-backed
media redirects after authorization to a presigned object URL whose storage
backend provides byte-range delivery.

`GET /assets/files/{assetId}?download=1` forces an original-file download. It
uses the same access ticket or authenticated credentials and current read
checks as the inline response. Chatto streams this mode on both storage
backends and sets `Content-Disposition: attachment` with the stored filename,
with path components and control characters removed and MIME encoding applied.
It preserves the private cache policy, `nosniff`, and active-document sandbox
headers. The optional query parameter does not change stored data or tickets.

Processed videos can instead expose HLS. Six-second MPEG-TS segments make
seeking and adaptive rendition switching independent of byte-range support.
HLS child responses remain behind Chatto so membership loss revokes an already
issued playlist ticket on its next playlist or segment request.

## Outbound bot endpoint management

`BotService.ListBotOutboundWebhooks`, `GetBotOutboundWebhook`,
`CreateBotOutboundWebhook`, `UpdateBotOutboundWebhook`, and
`RevokeBotOutboundWebhook`, and `ListBotWebhookFailures` require the bot owner or `bot.manage`.
Account-manager visibility alone does not grant access. Lists return the full
bounded collection of at most 20 endpoints. Reads expose names, saved URLs,
enabled state, creation time, and the latest recorded failure per endpoint.
`BotWebhookFailure` represents a recorded failure; `latest_failure` is absent
when no failure is retained. Success and skip statuses are not exposed.
Names and signing secrets are fixed; creation returns a signing secret once.
Update selects enabled, URL, and Authorization fields with an update mask.
Unselected fields keep their current values. Selected absent or empty
Authorization removes the header; a selected URL must remain valid.
Destination edits preserve creation time and cancel queued deliveries. Revocation removes one endpoint permanently.
Later successes do not clear a recorded failure. The delivery worker sends
JSON HTTP POST requests to external destinations; it mounts no new route.

`BotService.ListBotWebhookFailures` reads retained LOG records for one current
endpoint. Pages contain complete records in recording order, oldest first.
The cursor is encrypted and bound to the viewer, endpoint, and LOG incarnation.
Page size defaults to 20 and is limited to 100. A captured tail excludes later
appends from the current pagination session. Expired records are omitted.

## First-run setup

`chatto.auth.v1.ServerSetupService.CompleteSetup` is public only while the core
setup operation permits the claim. `ServerDiscoveryService.GetServer` returns
`setup_required`. The command creates a local owner and settings without an
email flow. It returns no credential; the client uses normal login afterward.
Account validation errors include `Chatto-Error-Field` response metadata with
`login`, `display_name`, or `password`. Clients use it to place the error below
the affected field. Errors without this metadata apply to the form.
The `[core] skip_setup_wizard` flag suppresses the command and discovery state.
See [FDR-047](../fdr/FDR-047-first-run-setup.md).

The call credential APIs require room membership and `call.join`. Starting a
call also requires `call.start`. Tokens encode `call.voice`, `call.camera`, and
`call.screenshare` as source restrictions; native companion credentials require
`call.screenshare`. Member-only observer reads and leaving do not require these
permissions. Room viewer-state permission rows expose the five actions through
existing room reads and realtime reconciliation.
