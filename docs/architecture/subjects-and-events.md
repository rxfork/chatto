## Event envelopes

Chatto uses `evtv1.Event` as the wrapper for durable EVT facts. It uses
`pubsubv1.PubSubEvent` as the wrapper for NATS Core pubsub events. The EVT
storage boundary accepts only `Event`.

- **Wrapper fields**: `id`, `created_at`, `actor_id`
- **Concrete event**: `event` oneof on the selected envelope; contextual fields (`room_id`, etc.) live on the concrete payloads.

Durable variants keep their existing field numbers. `PubSubEvent` field
numbers are local to its NATS wire shape.

Existing `Event` oneof field numbers are part of the persisted JetStream wire format; do not renumber or reuse them.

| `chatto.core.pubsub.v1`       | Restricted `PubSubEvent` wrapper and private control payloads; client-facing variants reference public realtime payloads | Records are not stored, but changes need rolling-wire review                                           |
| `chatto.realtime.v1`          | Public event union and dedicated public payload catalogue                                                                | Contains only client-visible fields; names and compact field numbers do not expose the internal source |

The packages generate separate Go packages. `core.EventEnvelope` is the
in-process realtime delivery interface. Private implementations let it carry a
durable EVT fact, a pubsub event, or a heartbeat.

The separate `Event` and `PubSubEvent` wrapper types make the distinction
between stored and non-durable events explicit. Client-facing `PubSubEvent`
variants reuse public payload messages, while the restricted private union
prevents durable-only variants from entering the cursorless path. The
publishers enforce this boundary.
Room queries and server subscriptions are delivery contexts.

**Self-Contained Events:** Each concrete event contains all the IDs and context it needs:

- Room events contain `room_id`.
- Membership events contain relevant IDs (`room_id` for room joins/leaves).
- Self-initiated events (e.g., `PresenceChanged`) use the parent wrapper's `actor_id` instead of duplicating a `user_id` field.

**Event Publishing Strategy:**

User-facing live delivery is built from two internal NATS Core subject roots:

1. **Primary Stream** (persistent):
   - `EVT` (subjects `evt.>`) holds event-sourced domain state. Its stream-level `RePublish` config forwards every committed event once onto `live.evt.>`. This is a raw committed-event feed, not a client contract.
2. **Direct Pubsub Publish** (non-durable):
   - `pubsubv1.PubSubEvent` values publish through NATS Core to `live.sync.>`
     with no stream storage.

On the durable write path,
[`evtstream.Publisher`](../../cli/internal/evtstream/publisher.go) validates the
Chatto envelope and encodes it with `proto.Marshal`. The underlying
[`events.EncodedEventLog`](../../pkg/events/encoded_event_log.go)
treats that result as opaque bytes while applying message-ID deduplication,
OCC, and atomic-batch headers. This boundary does not change the stored
protobuf bytes, subjects, headers, or sequence semantics; previous binaries can
read new records and current binaries can replay existing `EVT` history.

Authorization-sensitive commands use stable request-time authorization. They
capture the current `evt.rbac.>`, `evt.group.>`, and `evt.user.>` input tails,
wait for the related projections, evaluate the decision, and confirm that the
tails did not change during that decision. Low-frequency role-assignment checks
also stabilize `evt.room.>` because one role can contain decisions for many
rooms. Ordinary room commands use the exact room aggregate instead.

The final input validation is the authorization decision point. A later
cross-aggregate revocation is concurrent with the command and does not cancel
it. Domain events still use OCC for their owning aggregate or invariant. A
target aggregate conflict repeats the complete command from its original
intent.

Current writers do not publish `AuthorizationFenceAdvancedEvent`. The event,
protobuf field 830, event token, and
`evt.authorization.server.fence_advanced` subject remain historical replay
contracts.

User-facing reaction add/remove uses request-time authorization and a room
aggregate boundary. Each attempt waits the relevant room, reaction, group,
RBAC, and actor projections, reruns authorization and the reaction decision,
then appends against the captured room tail. A concurrent room mutation forces
a complete retry. A cross-aggregate authorization change does not
retroactively cancel an already-authorized, conflict-free reaction attempt;
subsequent requests observe the changed authorization state.

Pinned-message add/remove validates stable request-time authorization inputs,
captures the full room aggregate tail, and reruns `room.manage` plus message
lifecycle checks before a room-OCC append. A concurrent room change forces a
complete retry. Pins reference the canonical message ID; Room Timeline removes
an active association when that message is retracted.

`MyEventsModel` sits behind the `ChattoCore.StreamMyEvents` facade. Its
process-wide `MyEventsHub` subscribes once to each of `live.sync.>` and
`live.evt.>`.

Ingress rejects non-deliverable event types from their subjects before protobuf
decoding, including private `message_body` facts. It then decodes each event and
waits once for the required local projections. RBAC facts wait for the matching
RBAC projection and rebuild the shared effective-room cache of each connected
user and privileged-mode state before later events are considered. Role and permission changes can therefore
revoke implicit universal-room visibility without reconnecting.

User-facing message batches guard the room aggregate tail. Posting, editing,
attachment removal, preview removal, and pinning validate stable request-time
authorization inputs before the append. The room guard protects membership,
lifecycle, message state, Slow Mode, Threading Mode, and other room-owned
invariants. Traffic in other rooms does not cause a conflict.

Slow Mode is checked during message preflight and again inside that guarded
commit authorization. `RoomTimelineProjection` supplies the latest successful
non-echo post for the room and author in O(1), so the full-room OCC conflict
forces concurrent same-author posts on separate replicas to retry the complete
decision. Effective `room.manage` or `message.manage` bypasses the check.

Deliverable events are authorized per user and fanned as shared immutable
pointers to independent session queues. Asset lifecycle events resolve room
authorization through `AssetProjection`, using the scope on `AssetCreatedEvent`
and inherited parent scope for derivatives.

New sessions hydrate visibility outside the dispatcher lock against stable
authoritative room-visibility and RBAC EVT tails. They register through a
dispatcher-owned channel after the process drains ingress already received.
Ordinary room chatter does not participate in the stable-tail check.

Visibility changes processed during hydration force a retry. Late
cross-publisher facts already covered by the snapshot are suppressed by EVT
stream sequence; admission does not assume global NATS publisher ordering.

Pubsub events remain live-only. Protocol 4 maps selected durable and pubsub
events to an authorized public event
catalogue. The delivery boundary removes caller-specific hidden room
references. Durable events can have an opaque resume cursor. Fresh or unsafe
subscriptions use an exact authorized content snapshot or the caller's
live-only fallback. Subscriber overflow closes only that session.

Process-wide ingress loss or projection-readiness failure quarantines
admission, closes every current session, flushes and drains the old
subscriptions, and opens a fresh ingress generation. No session continues or
reconnects across an unobservable gap.

The bundled web client watches server heartbeats for silent stalls. Its
in-memory server projection resumes a short socket gap or rebuilds from an
exact WebSocket snapshot; page reload starts without a cursor. Protocol 4
creates no per-connection JetStream consumer. See [ADR-049](../adr/ADR-049-process-wide-realtime-event-hub.md)

| Live Sync       | `pubsubv1.PubSubEvent`             | Non-durable     | Direct NATS Core pubsub on `live.sync.>` for ephemeral activity and latest-value invalidations. `StreamMyEvents` authorizes them. Selected values become public realtime events. Internal controls can become protocol frames.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The republished `live.evt.{aggregateType}.{aggregateId}.{eventType}` subject is an internal server-side feed; `StreamMyEvents` waits for projections and authorization before delivering anything to clients.

The aggregate ID is intentionally part of the subject; actor/user and detailed context stay in the protobuf payload. Asset subjects are keyed by asset ID, while room scope lives in `AssetCreatedEvent` and is resolved by `AssetProjection`. Cross-event-type invariants use wildcard OCC filters such as `evt.room.>`, `evt.asset.>`, or `evt.rbac.>`.

## NATS service subjects

Trusted request/reply services use
`svc.{servingAuthority}.{service}.{majorVersion}.{endpoint}`. Chatto Core owns
`svc.chatto.>`, while replaceable providers, including bundled

The Search contract returns ordered message and room IDs. It does not grant
room visibility or make indexed content authoritative; Chatto Core rehydrates
and authorizes current message state before any public response. Provider
cursors are trusted integration coordinates and are not public API cursors.

An operator historical import uses the existing message-body and message-post
subjects. The body and post commit with any asset claims in one batch. The
post's event actor is the system; its `author_id` names the displayed author.
Its `historical_import` field remains in EVT so replay consumers suppress
posting effects. No source ID or deduplication record is stored.

Notes: Subject suffixes are stable NATS event tokens defined in [`cli/internal/evtstream/subjects.go`](../../cli/internal/evtstream/subjects.go). Protobuf message types are the concrete `evtv1.Event` oneof payloads defined in [`proto/chatto/core/evt/v1/event.proto`](../../proto/chatto/core/evt/v1/event.proto) and sibling `*_events.proto` files. The current asset write path uses `evt.asset.{assetId}.*`; `AssetProjection` also consumes beta-era `evt.room.{roomId}.asset_*` histories for replay compatibility.

Room-layout structural commands use atomic EVT batches. Channel-room creation
commits `RoomCreatedEvent` with `RoomAddedToGroupEvent`. Channel-room deletion
commits `RoomDeletedEvent` with `RoomRemovedFromGroupEvent`. Room-group creation
and deletion commit the group lifecycle fact with the resulting
`RoomGroupsReorderedEvent`. Each batch guards every room, group, layout, and
authorization boundary that its decision uses. Room moves also guard the
room-deletion subject, so a concurrent delete cannot leave a stale group
membership. See ADR-086.

`RoomCommandModel.UpdateRoom` commits all changed metadata, Universal, Slow
Mode, and Threading Mode facts in one atomic batch. A patch that supplies a
name guards `evt.room.>` for name uniqueness and target-room state. Other
patches guard `evt.room.{roomId}.>`. Each attempt repeats stable request-time
authorization under ADR-087, reads current room fields, and rebuilds the sparse
patch. Success waits for the room directory and timeline through the final
fact. See [FDR-019](../fdr/FDR-019-room-lifecycle.md) and
[`room_command_model.go`](../../cli/internal/core/room_command_model.go).

A thread reply with a requested channel echo commits its `MessageBodyEvent`,
canonical `MessagePostedEvent`, echo `MessagePostedEvent`, and any initial
`ThreadCreatedEvent` in one room-guarded batch. Attachment ownership and video
processing facts remain in that batch with their asset guards. Conflicts repeat
authorization, room-policy checks, mention resolution, and initial-thread
detection. Success waits for the timeline through the echo, the thread view,
and affected asset views. Automatic follows and read markers remain separate
post-commit work. See [FDR-003](../fdr/FDR-003-thread-reply-echo.md) and
[`messages.go`](../../cli/internal/core/messages.go).

These compound-command batches use existing payloads and subjects. Historical
replay and projection snapshots need no migration. Readers that understand the
existing facts can read the batches. During a deployment with older writers,
requests handled by those writers retain their former partial-write behavior;
the atomic command guarantee starts only after all writers have the fix. A
rollback can read the committed data but restores the old command behavior.
This change does not relax the separate exclusive-version cutover required by
ADR-087. Historical partial commands are not repaired, and an ambiguous commit
acknowledgement remains subject to the existing request-retry behavior.

For every attachment message, its `AssetAttachedEvent` is committed in the same
atomic OCC batch as the owning message body and posted fact. Video messages add
the Started fact to that batch. The batch guards the room and authorization
boundaries and the complete aggregate of every attached asset, so concurrent
attachments, pending expiry, and deletion cannot commit conflicting transitions.
The asset event is permanent ownership evidence and does not contain an attachment
description. The current `MessageBodyEvent` holds each description as a separate
author-key envelope. A message edit encrypts retained descriptions again against
the replacement body event, and obsolete body events use secure deletion.

Failed or losing processing attempts perform bounded prompt cleanup by
appending ordinary derivative `AssetDeletedEvent` facts. If cleanup is
interrupted before a tombstone is appended, the unused derivative is not
durably discoverable. An ambiguous success append is checked by exact event ID;
if that confirmation also fails, the processor retains the output rather than
risk deleting assets referenced by a committed manifest.

## Pubsub subjects

Pubsub activity uses `pubsubv1.PubSubEvent` values and is published directly
on NATS Core. It is not persisted. Genuinely ephemeral activity
can be a public cursorless event. Latest-value invalidations are inputs to live
projection assembly but are not replay facts.

Patterns: `live.sync.>` for `PubSubEvent` values and `live.evt.>`
for raw EVT committed facts. `myEvents` consumes both roots server-side:

- Direct NATS Core publishes: `PubSubEvent` messages on `live.sync.>` with
  no stream storage.
- `EVT` RePublish (`evt.>` → `live.evt.>`): every committed event-sourced fact is re-emitted once by JetStream. Chatto replicas must wait for local projection readiness and authorize before exposing deliverable room or asset events to clients.

`SERVER_EVENTS` no longer has a `RePublish` live path and runtime code no longer writes legacy `server.>` mirrors. Historical `SERVER_EVENTS` streams may still appear in old backups, but current boot and live-delivery paths do not read or import them.

**Pubsub events** (`live.sync.{user,config,room}.>`):

| Subject                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `live.sync.user.{userId}.notification_v2`     | Notification occurrence created, triaged, removed, or delivery eligibility changed; requests a current occurrence/count read and includes the notification ID on creation, independent of sound policy |
| `live.sync.user.{userId}.notification_unread` | Badge attention changed; triggers authoritative room viewer-state replacement. A thread marker contributes to its parent room state                                                                    |
| `live.sync.user.{userId}.thread_viewer_state` | Current thread follow or read state changed outside the durable follow command                                                                                                                         |
| `live.sync.user.{userId}.room_read`           | Room marked as read                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `live.sync.user.{userId}.session_terminated`  | Active session revoked (logout-other-devices, account deletion)                                                                                                                                        |
| `live.sync.user.{userId}.presence_preference` | Current private availability changed; requests an account-owned read, with no choice in the signal                                                                                                     |
| `live.sync.room.{kind}.{roomId}.user_typing`  | User typing in a room                                                                                                                                                                                  |

User profile, private preference, public server profile, and durable thread
follow changes use their EVT facts on `live.evt.>`. The realtime mapper groups
related facts into `UserProfileChangedEvent`, `ViewerPreferencesChangedEvent`,
`ServerProfileChangedEvent`, or `ThreadViewerStateChangedEvent`. Presence comes
from the process-local `PresenceHub`; it does not use a `live.sync.>` subject.

`live.sync.user.{userId}.presence_preference` carries the private transient
`ViewerPresencePreferenceChanged` invalidation. The current choice lives at
`presence.{userId}` in `RUNTIME_STATE`; presence changes never enter EVT.
Public presence is derived from this choice and live heartbeat state.

Room-group and sidebar-layout changes use durable group or layout facts only.
The command path waits until the local `ServerContentView` applies the final
fact. JetStream republishes each fact on `live.evt.>` for realtime delivery.

Voice call lifecycle and participant transitions are durable room EVT facts:
`evt.room.{roomId}.call_started`, `evt.room.{roomId}.call_joined`,
`evt.room.{roomId}.call_left`, and `evt.room.{roomId}.call_ended`. JetStream
republishes them to `live.evt.>` for realtime delivery. They drive active-call
state and indicators. Call-started and call-ended facts are also visible room
timeline entries; participant join/leave facts remain hidden from room history.

LiveKit room names include the active Chatto call ID suffix. Participant and
room-finished observations therefore apply only to the matching call session.
Join-token participant metadata carries the login, avatar URL, and account kind
needed to preserve canonical user identity, including bot markers, while the
client is rendering directly from LiveKit state.
Only the replica holding `lease.livekit_reconciler` in `MEMORY_CACHE` runs the
periodic reconciliation loop.

Reconciliation appends `RECONCILIATION` facts for participant mismatches in the
matching call session. It disconnects participants from rooms that no longer
match a projected active call. At startup, it also replays durable `call_ended`
facts to retry any per-call E2EE key shredding that did not complete after the
original commit.

Missing or observed-empty LiveKit rooms end projected calls immediately after
a successful listing. A per-room `not_found` while listing participants is
treated as that room being gone or empty, so other rooms can still reconcile.

Listing failures increment the shared
`livekit.reconciliation.list_failures` key and retry on the normal ticker. They
end projected calls only after three consecutive failed elected reconciliation
cycles. A successful elected pass deletes the counter.

`VoiceCallService.GetActiveCall`, `BatchGetActiveCalls`, `CreateCallToken`, and
`ListCallParticipants` expose the active call ID to integrations and command
flows. The bundled frontend receives complete authorized active-call state
with semantic call events and infers one-shot join, leave, and end presentation
effects by comparing current state. Room membership remains the authorization
boundary for live delivery.

The `/api/realtime` WebSocket is backed by the single core stream `StreamMyEvents`, which combines:

- One process-wide `ChanSubscribe("live.sync.>")` for `PubSubEvent`
  messages and one `ChanSubscribe("live.evt.>")` for raw committed EVT facts.
  Subject classification and decoding happen once. Authorization then applies
  per connected user and privileged-mode state using shared room visibility,
  asset room membership,
  user/config/member subject gates, and projection readiness.
- Live delivery plus protocol-4 bounded replay of authorized public durable
  events. The WebSocket subscribes to the hub before it captures its EVT
  cutoff, replays through that cutoff, and then drops buffered duplicates
  before it continues live. Fresh and unsafe subscriptions use an exact
  authorized content snapshot or the requested live-only fallback. Cursorless
  pubsub activity remains live-only.
- The PresenceHub (two per-process KV watchers on `presence.>` in `RUNTIME_STATE` and `MEMORY_CACHE`, deriving public status changes for subscribers).
- An in-process heartbeat ticker (synthetic `Heartbeat` event every 15s for client-side liveness detection).

## Outbound bot webhooks

Configuration uses `evt.user.{botId}.bot_outbound_webhook_configured` with
user-aggregate OCC and encrypted credentials. Process-local delivery work uses
a Go structure in the [webhook worker](../../cli/internal/core/bot_webhook_worker.go);
it has no persisted protobuf or NATS subject.
The delivery ID hashes the bot, endpoint, and source event IDs.

Terminal failures append
`log.bot_webhook.<bot-id>.<webhook-id>.delivery_failed.<delivery-id>`.
The envelope and payload live in
[`chatto.core.log.v1`](../../proto/chatto/core/log/v1/entry.proto).
Subject OCC suppresses duplicates while the record is retained. These records
do not enter EVT or the public realtime catalogue.

### Outbound webhook lifecycle

`evt.user.<bot-id>.bot_outbound_webhook_configured` stores encrypted endpoint
creation and destination edits. Edits reuse the endpoint ID and preserve the
first creation time. The encrypted payload contains the
name, URL, Authorization value, and signing secret.
`evt.user.<bot-id>.bot_outbound_webhook_updated` pauses or resumes one endpoint.
`evt.user.<bot-id>.bot_outbound_webhook_revoked` permanently revokes one endpoint.
All endpoint commands use the user aggregate OCC boundary.
Failure recording uses LOG independently of these domain lifecycle events.

## First-run setup

The singleton `evt.setup.server.>` owns `server_setup_offered` and
`server_initialized`. These facts contain no credentials or PII. Core records
eligibility before boot defaults only when EVT has never contained events.
Existing histories receive `server_initialized`. Initial owner creation,
owner assignment, settings, and completion share one whole-EVT OCC batch.
The owning core operation reads the latest setup fact directly from EVT;
no snapshot or separate projection controls eligibility. These facts are not
public realtime events. EVT backup and restore include them automatically.

### Echo writes

An echo appends one `message_posted` fact with the original reply ID and thread
routing. It has no `message_body` fact or copied mention and reply-attribution
fields. Full and partial content edits append the original message's body and
edit facts only. Edit-driven echo creation or removal shares the parent edit's
room-OCC batch.
