# FDR-008: File Attachments & Video Processing

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-10-09

## Overview

Users can attach files to messages — images, videos, documents — via drag-and-drop, paste, or file picker. Images are dimensioned and resizable on the fly via signed URLs. When video processing is enabled, new videos are transcoded into adaptive HLS streams; animated GIFs and historical processed videos retain the MP4 path.

## Behavior

- The composer accepts files via drag-and-drop, paste, and a file picker button when the viewer has `message.attach`.
- Draft attachments persist across room switches inside the same session.
- Message attachments are uploaded through `chatto.api.v1.AssetUploadService` before message creation. The browser sends bounded unary chunks with SHA-256 checksums, then calls `MessageService.CreateMessage` with completed attachment asset IDs.
- A completed asset can be attached only by its uploader and to one exact message. Reusing another member's asset ID, or reusing one's own already-attached asset ID, is rejected.
- While a message's attachments are being prepared and uploaded, the bundled composer keeps their previews visible, reports committed upload progress for each file, and disables editing and composer actions until the send finishes. A failed send keeps the submitted text and attachments available for correction or retry.
- A member can add one plain-text description to each message attachment before send. The composer keeps the description in memory and sends it only after the upload returns an asset ID. Descriptions can contain line breaks. Chatto trims outer whitespace, limits each value to 1,000 Unicode characters, and treats an empty value as removal.
- Message authors can change attachment descriptions during the message-edit window. Effective `message.manage` permission bypasses the time limit and permits changes to other members' descriptions. A change marks the message as edited and refreshes current message views through the existing bodyless message-edited signal.
- In messages, hovering over an image, video, audio player, or file card shows its description in a native browser tooltip when a description exists. Attachment action buttons keep their action labels. Keyboard and touch users can read descriptions in the attachment viewer.
- Image descriptions are alt text, with the filename as fallback. In the shared attachment viewer, static images have a Details panel that starts closed to give the image more space. The panel shows the selected image's description, type, and size beside the image on desktop and below it on smaller screens. The description remains available to assistive technology while the panel is closed. Other file descriptions stay visible beside or below the preview, including before HTML preview consent. Long descriptions scroll without hiding Download or Close. Video, audio, and file controls expose descriptions to assistive technology.
- Default upload size limits: 25 MB for general files, 100 MB for videos when video processing is enabled.
- Video uploads require server-side video processing to be enabled. When it is disabled, the composer rejects `video/*` files immediately and the message-post API rejects them before storage.
- Images are inspected for dimensions at upload time and can be resized at render time via URL parameters (width, height, fit mode). Public attachment and avatar APIs expose transform parameters; public server branding images expose canonical URLs only.
- The room timeline loads attachment images within 960×400 bounds, while the lightbox loads a separate derivative within 2048×2048 bounds. The untouched upload remains available through the viewer’s Download action.
- Right-clicking an image attachment in a message opens the message menu with **Copy Image**. It copies the displayed image as PNG. Other message menu actions remain available. The image URL is not offered as a copy action because it contains a temporary access ticket.
- When enabled, videos and animated GIFs are processed by durable `asset-processing` runtime-unit workers. The processing marker commits atomically with the owning message, so a rejected message cannot create work and an accepted message remains queued while workers are offline. Workers may run inside `chatto run` or as separate `chatto asset-processing` processes.
- Processing status: durable STARTED / COMPLETED / FAILED outcomes are stored as asset aggregate events (`evt.asset.{assetId}.*`) and delivered through the normal live EVT subscription path after room-membership authorization and the applicable message-read check for the owning thread. There is no separate `video_processed` live event or new runtime KV state for video progress; failed videos keep the original message visible and show a processing-failed state, while the retained original remains available through the attachment's original/download action.
- Processed video dimensions are display dimensions used for layout, not necessarily raw encoded storage pixels. Non-square-pixel and rotated sources should render in their intended orientation and aspect ratio. The room timeline displays every posted video uncropped at its measured aspect ratio, including unusual near-square dimensions and converted animated GIF loops. The player canvas is bounded to the available timeline width and a maximum height; for ratios beyond 9:16 or 16:9, it uses letterboxing so playback controls remain usable without cropping the video.
- A thumbnail is generated from an early video frame using the same display dimensions, so non-square-pixel sources do not persist squished or pillarboxed poster images.
- For newly processed ordinary videos, the public attachment view exposes a signed HLS master-playlist URL. The durable processing manifest stores HLS rendition metadata and no MP4 variant. Existing processed videos are not backfilled; when HLS metadata is absent, the new client continues through their historical MP4 path.
- Opaque static attachment derivatives use JPEG quality 75. Derivatives that require transparency or animation use lossless WebP, and resized results can be held in the auto-expiring server cache.
- Browser media uses direct signed asset URLs. Relative attachment URLs are resolved against the server that owns the message or room-file item, so remote-server images, audio, and video can load without cross-site cookies or bearer headers. Chatto-streamed NATS objects are full, non-seekable responses; S3-backed passive media redirects to object storage for byte-range delivery.
- Clients refresh expiring attachment URL fields through room-scoped `AssetService.GetAsset` / `BatchGetAssets`, or by refetching the relevant timeline or room attachment-list page. The timeline, previews, lightbox, downloads, and room-files surfaces refresh before expiry and retry after media load errors.
- Every message attachment opens in the shared attachment viewer, with a filename header, file type and size, Download, and Close. Static images have a larger dark stage. Viewers can zoom from Fit to 1600% with controls, a wheel or trackpad, double-click, or touch pinch, then drag to pan. Zoom and pan reset when they select another image. The image keeps the browser's native context menu, so viewers can copy or save it. Images in the same message form a gallery with previous/next controls and arrow-key navigation that wraps. Gallery selection changes the preview, metadata, and download target within one history entry. Back or Escape closes the viewer and restores focus. The viewer fills small screens and keeps its controls outside the pan surface. Images use bounded derivatives, audio and video use media players, Markdown uses a rendered document preview, and unsupported files show a download-only fallback. Inline audio and video controls remain available in the timeline, with a separate viewer button.
- Videos, processed GIFs, and audio attachments have an icon button to open the viewer, with no filename row below the media. The tooltip and accessible label include the filename. Controls follow this order: Delete, Open in viewer, Edit description. Unavailable actions leave no gap. Delete uses a trash icon. Buttons use the standard secondary style and follow the Flat, Kinda 3D, and Very 3D preference. Delete shows the destructive style on hover or keyboard focus. Audio attachments use a compact card with always-visible horizontal actions beside the player, like ordinary file cards. Actions wrap below the player in narrow messages. Image and video buttons appear at the upper right on hover or keyboard focus on desktop and stay visible on small screens. Opening the viewer pauses that attachment's inline playback.
- Ordinary file cards keep the filename as the viewer action. Delete and Edit description use the same buttons as media attachments, arranged beside the filename and always visible when permitted.
- Markdown attachments open a rendered preview automatically. The viewer recognises Markdown document types and `.md` or `.markdown` files with a plain-text, generic, or missing type. The preview uses message Markdown formatting, keeps mentions as plain text, and does not run HTML or load embedded images. Document links open only when selected. Long documents scroll while Download and Close stay available. Download saves the original file. A failed preview offers Retry.
- HTML and XHTML attachments use Download and Show preview controls in this shared viewer. The document stays unloaded until the user selects Show preview. A notice explains that external websites can see the viewer's IP address if the document loads their content. Consent applies only to the current opening. Download saves the original file without enabling the preview. The viewer shows the document type and original file size before and after consent. File size comes from an authenticated metadata read that does not fetch the document. If that read fails, the viewer shows an unavailable size and keeps preview and download available.
- Active document attachment types such as HTML, XHTML, SVG, and XML use a browser sandbox so uploaded scripts cannot run as trusted Chatto application code.
- The room sidebar Files panel lists current accessible attachments from both root messages and thread replies, grouped by date as Today, Yesterday, This week, This month, then older calendar months. Date groups use the same separated, collapsible sidebar-section treatment as room navigation and remember their expanded state per room. Rows show a thumbnail or file-type icon, filename, and upload time. Selecting a file opens only that file in the shared attachment viewer. Closing the viewer returns to the same list position. A separate circle-arrow button goes to the upload message: it brings a root message into view, or opens the thread pane and highlights a thread reply. These separate actions let users view files without losing their place in the conversation.
- The Files panel is virtualized in the same way as the room member list (FDR-025).
  The client mounts only the date headings and rows near the visible part of the
  list. The next page loads when the end of the full list comes into view.
- Each room's Files list starts empty and is loaded only when that panel is first opened. Once loaded, incoming message, edit, deletion, and processing updates keep the cached rows current without reloading the whole list; rooms whose Files panel has never opened make no attachment-list request.
- Deleting a message-owned attachment durably revokes access first, then removes its source/derivative bytes and transform-cache entries. Shared durable-consumer replicas retry failed physical deletion after process restart or replica handover.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Attachment uploads use chunked ConnectRPC sessions

**Decision:** Public message attachment uploads use `AssetUploadService`: `CreateUpload`, `UploadChunk`, `GetUpload`, `CompleteUpload`, and `CancelUpload`. Chunks are bounded unary ConnectRPC requests instead of browser client-streaming RPCs. Each upload declares the final file size and lowercase SHA-256 digest, each chunk carries its offset and chunk SHA-256, and `CompleteUpload` verifies the assembled digest before creating the durable asset. `CreateMessage` accepts only completed, live, room-matching asset IDs uploaded by the caller and atomically attaches each asset exclusively to the message.
New sessions accept chunks up to 10 MiB. Clients use the limit returned by the server. The limit is fixed; operators do not need to configure it. Larger chunks reduce the number of acknowledgement waits on connections with high latency. Each request needs more memory, and a failed chunk can require more bytes to be sent again.

**Why:** Attachments should remain inside the protobuf/ConnectRPC API surface instead of introducing a second REST upload endpoint. Unary chunks work with the current browser Connect stack and give resumable progress through the committed offset.
**Tradeoff:** Clients must hash the full file before completion and issue several RPCs for larger files. Temporary chunks and open sessions need cleanup if the browser disappears before completion. Retrying a send after the first attempt actually committed must hydrate the created message rather than attach the same asset to a second message.

### 2. Dual storage backends (NATS ObjectStore + S3)

**Decision:** Attachments can be stored in NATS ObjectStore (default, good for development and small deployments) or in an S3-compatible bucket (production-grade). Each asset records its storage backend and logical key at upload time; S3 deployments may add a configurable object-key prefix that is applied only at the S3 client boundary.
**Why:** Self-hosters running a single binary shouldn't have to spin up S3 just to send a screenshot. Larger operators need durable, replicated object storage. Supporting both lets us serve both ends of the spectrum. See ADR-021.
**Tradeoff:** Migration between backends or S3 prefixes is operator-managed. Stored asset keys remain prefix-free so moving objects between S3 base paths does not require rewriting Chatto metadata. Ordinary NATS-backed files still use complete non-seekable responses, but processed videos use bounded HLS segments and are seekable on either backend.

### 3. Video processing uses an EVT-backed durable worker queue

**Decision:** `AssetProcessingStartedEvent` is both the user-visible PENDING fact and the durable work item. It is appended atomically with the owning message and consumed by one shared JetStream pull consumer across all `asset-processing` runtime-unit replicas. A worker acknowledges only after projecting a terminal succeeded, failed, or deleted state. See ADR-066.
**Why:** Processing is an asynchronous obligation rather than a synchronous service request. Keeping the request in EVT avoids an outbox gap, while a durable consumer supplies distribution, redelivery, backpressure, and offline-worker tolerance without making message posting depend on worker availability.
**Tradeoff:** Delivery is at least once, so workers can repeat external ffmpeg/storage work after an interruption. Terminal-event OCC prevents manifest replacement, but interrupted or losing attempts can still leave unused derivative objects until durable failed-generation cleanup is added. Pre-queue histories receive a bounded startup backfill for messages with no processing marker.

### 4. Animated GIFs go through the video pipeline

**Decision:** When video processing is enabled, animated GIFs are detected at upload and routed to the video transcoder rather than served as raw images. When video processing is disabled, GIFs remain allowed as image uploads.
**Why:** Animated GIF files are typically much larger than equivalent MP4s, and they're inefficient to decode in browsers. Transcoding to MP4 produces smaller, smoother playback.
**Tradeoff:** A static thumbnail is shown until processing finishes, even for GIFs that would have rendered immediately as-is. Worth it for the playback experience and bandwidth savings.

### 5. New processed videos persist HLS segments only

**Decision:** Transcoding temporarily produces H.264 MP4 renditions whose target resolutions are derived from the source display resolution. A 1080p source might yield 720p and 480p; a 480p source skips the higher tiers. Video audio is encoded as AAC stereo so every independently loaded MPEG-TS segment carries a browser-compatible channel layout, including when the upload has quad or another unusual multichannel layout. Encoders force aligned six-second keyframes, then ffmpeg packages each temporary file into MPEG-TS segments without another encode. Only the thumbnail and segments are uploaded. The terminal manifest records rendition dimensions, peak bandwidth, and each segment's asset ID and exact duration. Chatto generates master and media playlists from that manifest on every authorised request. Animated GIF loops continue using one durable MP4 derivative directly.
**Why:** Bounded HLS segments provide duration, seeking, and adaptive rendition switching even when the asset backend can only stream complete objects. Generating small playlists on demand avoids storing duplicate MP4 media or request-specific playlist URLs.
Generated segments and MP4 derivatives stream to storage without a user upload size limit. A segment can exceed the upload limit if the source requires it; storage capacity and the processing time budget still apply.
**Tradeoff:** HLS packaging or segment upload failure is a failed processing outcome for a new ordinary video. The processor publishes that terminal outcome with an independent bounded context, then uses a separate bounded context to tombstone and delete partial derivatives. Cleanup interrupted before every tombstone is written can leave unused storage orphaned until durable failed-generation cleanup replaces this best-effort path. A success append with an ambiguous result is checked by exact event ID. If confirmation also fails, Chatto retains the output rather than risk deleting assets referenced by a committed manifest, which can also leave orphaned storage if the success did not commit. An uncommitted derivative creation has no canonical storage fact and likewise relies on bounded prompt compensation. A processing attempt that exceeds its fixed 30-minute worker budget becomes a terminal failure rather than repeating the same expensive work forever; worker shutdown remains retryable. Historical processed videos are not backfilled; their manifests omit HLS and the new client continues using their MP4 variants. Older clients cannot play new HLS-only manifests, which is an accepted pre-1.0 compatibility break. During a server rollout, every replica behind one endpoint must understand HLS before new HLS-only videos are created: an older replica cannot expose the HLS metadata or serve playlist and segment routes. An older replica can also ignore HLS child IDs while deleting a source; the durable asset-cleanup consumer on a newer replica re-reads the source manifest and tombstones any still-live HLS segments. Videos whose meaningful content occupies only part of the encoded canvas retain that empty space because the player does not guess which parts are safe to crop.

### 6. Attachments are declared content; derivative manifests are durable events

**Decision:** `AssetCreatedEvent` records each uploaded or generated binary as a first-class `Asset` on `evt.asset.{assetId}.asset_created`. `Asset` carries inline storage and flat media metadata such as dimensions, duration, and bitrate; room scope, uploader, and derivative context live on `AssetCreatedEvent`. Uploaded assets awaiting attachment also record SHA-256, expiry, and video-processing hints. Message posting atomically appends an `AssetAttachedEvent` for every attachment and an `AssetProcessingStartedEvent` for newly uploaded video/animated-GIF assets. Durable runtime-unit workers consume the processing facts. After transcoding succeeds, the original upload is retained as source content, and generated thumbnails and HLS segments—or the MP4 derivative for an animated GIF—are appended as derivative `AssetCreatedEvent`s whose owner points at the original asset. Durable failed/unavailable outcomes are recorded with `AssetProcessingFailedEvent.failure_code` and are mapped to stable client-facing failure reasons. Beta histories remain readable through the asset projection's legacy subscription lanes, with the first surviving message-body reference authored by the recorded uploader treated as owner.
**Why:** Attachments and video derivatives are content metadata, not runtime state. Making assets their own aggregates gives projections a single asset graph (`message -> original asset -> derivative assets`), keeps binary lifecycle facts out of the room aggregate, and lets future uploads exist outside messages without a parallel asset model. Keeping the original allows future re-encoding, and storing processing outcomes in EVT lets processed playback survive projection rebuilds and storage-boundary cleanup.
**Tradeoff:** Retaining originals costs more storage than the old replace-after-transcode behavior. Processing execution is at least once: the durable Started fact survives crashes, but ffmpeg and storage work may repeat before one terminal event wins. Every write-serving replica must be upgraded together for exclusive attachment to be a security boundary; an older replica neither enforces nor understands `AssetAttachedEvent` and can reopen attachment aliasing during a mixed-version rollout. Moving new writes from room aggregates to asset aggregates means older beta binaries must not be rolled back after new asset-subject writes have occurred; compatibility is maintained by this and later versions reading both subject shapes, not by rewriting history.

### 7. Attachment URLs are per-user signed capabilities

**Decision:** Public attachment APIs expose attachment media as stable asset paths plus per-user access tickets: `/assets/files/{assetId}?access={ticket}` for originals and `/assets/files/{assetId}/image/{width}x{height}/{fit}?access={ticket}` for image derivatives. HLS uses a domain-separated, source-video-scoped ticket on `/assets/hls/{assetId}/master.m3u8`; Chatto generates each playlist with authorised child routes and checks every requested segment against the durable derivative manifest. Attachment, thumbnail, video thumbnail, HLS master, and historical variant URLs expose the ticket expiry so the client can refresh before or after a lazy-load miss. Every fetch verifies that the signed user is still a room member and has broad `message.read`, or `message.read-interactions` with a relationship to the asset's owning thread.
**Why:** Cross-origin `<img>` tags (used when the SPA loads attachments from a _remote_ registered server) can't carry session cookies (SameSite) or Authorization headers. A signed per-user access ticket lets browsers load remote attachments directly, while current membership and applicable permission checks revoke access after an access boundary changes.
**Tradeoff:** The access ticket is a bearer capability — anyone holding it can fetch until the expiry passes, the signed user loses room membership, or the signed user loses applicable channel-room message-read authority. Tickets use hourly issuance buckets and retain **23–24 hours** of validity, so repeated reads within a bucket return the same URL while normal rendering, lazy loading, deferred media startup, and lightbox use remain reliable across long-lived room views. Timeline, preview, and room-files clients use the exposed expiry to refresh shortly before it; the attachment viewer refreshes images on opening, refreshes expired URLs before preview or download, and retries media failures once before showing an error. Late refresh results cannot change a closed viewer or a different gallery selection. Media load errors also trigger refreshes. Protected asset responses use `private, no-store`, so browser-visible protected bytes are not reused as authorization state. HLS segments stream through Chatto on both backends, while short-lived S3 redirects remain reserved for heavy passive originals such as video, audio, and large files. Rotating `[core.assets].signing_secret` invalidates all outstanding access tickets.

### 8. HTML previews require consent and use a browser sandbox

**Decision:** HTML and XHTML attachments use a large modal with an initially disabled preview. The user can download the original file immediately or select Show preview after a notice about external connections. Consent is not saved. The preview uses an iframe with no sandbox permissions and sends no referrer. Original attachment responses for active document formats (HTML, XHTML, SVG, XML, and XML-derived media types) include a CSP sandbox and `nosniff`. S3-backed attachments of those types stream through Chatto instead of redirecting directly to a presigned object URL, so the same response policy applies.
**Why:** Users need both viewing and downloading. External document resources can reveal the viewer's IP address, so preview loading requires an explicit choice. Uploaded active content must not become trusted Chatto application code. A sandbox without same-origin privileges preserves the viewing use case while preventing the easiest same-origin stored-XSS path.
**Tradeoff:** Scripts, forms, top-level navigation, and same-origin APIs are restricted inside uploaded active documents. Keyboard events inside the sandbox do not reach the viewer. Users can select Close or move focus to the viewer controls before pressing Escape. S3 deployments also lose the zero-copy redirect fast path for those active document types, while heavy passive originals can still use a short-lived S3 redirect after Chatto authorizes the request.

### 9. Room Files panel is a read projection, not durable attachment state

**Decision:** `Room.attachments` exposes a paginated list of current message
attachments for a room. The read uses the Room Timeline projection's compact
attachment index to select a page before it loads current message bodies from
EVT. It includes thread replies, preserves attachment order within each
message, and sorts by newest message first. The bundled client owns one lazy
file cache per room in its server-scoped state: opening Files hydrates it once,
after which authoritative timeline message snapshots reconcile attachment rows
already in the cache and newly posted attachments are inserted directly.
**Why:** Files should disappear from the sidebar when their message body is retracted or the attachment is removed. The frontend shares bounded message reads across timelines, Files, and pins. Each affected message supplies the current attachment data to all loaded views, including Files when a reply's thread is closed. This keeps the views consistent without separate message reads for each panel or repeated full-list reads.
**Tradeoff:** There is no search or media filtering in this iteration. Hydrated room caches consume client memory for the server session, and attachment changes beyond a partially loaded page converge when that page is loaded.

### 10. Displayed images use bounded derivatives

**Decision:** Timeline images fit within 960×400 bounds and lightbox images fit within 2048×2048 bounds. Opaque static derivatives use JPEG quality 75, while transparency and animation continue to use lossless WebP. Original uploads remain unchanged and available separately.
**Why:** Timeline frames are much smaller than typical camera and screenshot uploads, and even full-screen viewing rarely benefits from transferring the source resolution. Separate display sizes reduce bandwidth without sacrificing the original file-sharing behavior.
**Tradeoff:** Opaque displayed images are lossy and capped in resolution. Transparent and animated images may see smaller savings because preserving their behavior requires lossless encoding.

### 11. Message-owned asset deletion is replayable

**Decision:** A message or attachment delete may tombstone an asset and touch its backing objects only when `AssetAttachedEvent` names that exact room and message. Historical duplicate references are removed from the aliasing message without deleting the canonical owner's asset. Request paths still attempt immediate NATS/S3 and transform-cache deletion, while shared `chatto-asset-cleanup-v1` durable-consumer replicas process canonical `AssetDeletedEvent` facts and retry each idempotent cleanup independently. The asset ID locates the same aggregate's durable `AssetCreatedEvent`, which supplies storage metadata even after the in-memory projection drops it. Beta room-scoped histories without a canonical asset creation aggregate are skipped rather than probing guessed object keys.
**Why:** A committed deletion must remain recoverable when immediate storage cleanup fails, the process exits, or another replica committed the event. Resolving the immutable creation fact preserves that guarantee without duplicating storage metadata in the deletion event or depending on a mutable projection.
**Tradeoff:** Each cleanup requires an aggregate-history lookup, and a fresh worker replays prior deletion facts idempotently. Beta room-scoped events cannot gain the same guarantee without a migration or unsafe backend-key inference, and server branding/avatar cleanup remains outside this message-owned worker.

### 12. Durable worker health is shared and owner-visible

**Decision:** Owner-only admin diagnostics derive asset cleanup and the other known durable-worker queue states directly from JetStream. The System tab reports inactive, healthy, working, unconfirmed, stalled, or unavailable state plus queue depth, ack-pending deliveries, unresolved redeliveries, and delivery progress. It does not expose asset IDs, filenames, storage keys, raw errors, or a reclaimed-byte estimate.
**Why:** Automatic retry is only operationally useful when self-hosters can tell whether the worker is available and whether durable work remains. Shared consumer state makes that answer consistent regardless of which replica serves the admin request.
**Tradeoff:** Broker state is point-in-time. Waiting pulls demonstrate availability, but an ack-pending delivery without a waiter may be actively handled or awaiting recovery after a crash, so diagnostics report that state as unconfirmed. The unresolved-redelivery count resets as messages are acknowledged and does not identify which current item retried; the consumer also does not expose the age of its oldest pending delivery. Counts describe queued and unacknowledged work, not historical deletion totals, and idempotent cleanup cannot reliably attribute reclaimed bytes.

### 13. Attachment descriptions are encrypted message metadata

**Decision:** `MessageBody` stores one encrypted description envelope per described attachment, keyed by asset ID. Each envelope records its encryption version, the original author's message-body DEK epoch, nonce, and ciphertext. Its authenticated data is domain-separated and binds the description to the room, canonical message, body event, author, asset, key epoch, and description purpose. Every body replacement decrypts descriptions transiently and encrypts them again for the new body event, including linked channel echoes. Obsolete body events use the existing secure-delete process. `AssetAttachedEvent` remains the permanent asset-to-message ownership link and contains no description. `Asset`, upload-session state, snapshots, logs, realtime event payloads, and search indexes do not contain description plaintext.

**Why:** A description can identify a person or disclose message context. It must follow message editing, retraction, secure deletion, and author-key shredding. It describes one use of an asset in one message, so it is not intrinsic file metadata. Permanent asset lifecycle evidence must remain useful after message PII is deleted.

**Tradeoff:** Hydrating a message or room-file row must decrypt the current description. Editing any message-body field encrypts every retained description again because the body-event ID is part of authenticated data. Existing messages need no migration and return no description. All message-writing replicas must understand this metadata before clients create it. A rollback to an older writer after descriptions exist is not supported.

### 14. Attachment types share one viewer shell

**Decision:** Message attachments use one history-backed viewer shell. The shell owns the filename, file metadata, gallery controls, and download action. On desktop, a side panel holds the description, metadata, gallery controls, and Download. Smaller screens place these below the preview. Images use a subtle background without an outline and fit without cropping. Preview components use the existing image and media paths. HTML keeps its per-opening consent gate. Files without a supported preview show a download action without loading their bytes. Gallery navigation stays local to one opening and unmounts the previous media. The dialog fills viewports below 640 CSS pixels and uses a large framed layout on wider screens, with controls outside the preview.
**Why:** Every file needs an accessible download action and consistent dismissal. A shared shell keeps mobile layout and keyboard behavior consistent while preserving image galleries and HTML privacy controls.
**Tradeoff:** Images in one message form a gallery; other attachments open individually. PDF, text, archive, and other unsupported formats have no built-in preview. The viewer adds no document parser, external service, protocol field, or stored-data migration.

## Permissions

Posting an attachment requires room membership, the relevant message-posting permission (`message.post` or `message.post-in-thread`), and `message.attach`. The `message.attach` permission is configurable at server, group, and room scope and only gates message attachments; server branding uploads, user avatars, link previews, and attachment deletion use their existing checks.

Reading attachment metadata or bytes requires room membership. Reads also
require broad `message.read`, or `message.read-interactions` with a
relationship to the asset's owning thread. This check applies again when a
client uses an existing signed or ticketed asset URL.

Fresh servers seed `message.attach` for `everyone` so new deployments keep uploads enabled by default. Existing servers are not automatically backfilled after upgrade; operators should grant `message.attach` manually or through their chosen RBAC maintenance flow if existing rooms should keep allowing uploads.

## Burn After Reading

- The sender can mark each supported attachment **Burn after reading** before
  sending. Images, audio, video, PDF, Markdown, plain text, JSON, and XML can use
  the controlled viewer. HTML and download-only formats cannot.
- The client checks that the server supports burn mode before uploading or
  posting. It refuses a burn send to an older server instead of publishing an
  ordinary file.
- All API and asset-serving replicas must support burn mode before it is used.
  Older binaries do not enforce its stored policy. Rolling those replicas back
  while burn attachments remain in storage is not supported.
- A channel and a DM use the same rule: each account in the room at send time,
  including the sender, gets one viewing session. Later members get no session.
  Current room membership and message-read permission are still required.
- Opening the viewer starts the session. Closing it or reaching its deadline
  ends access. A second device cannot claim another session. Metadata reads,
  history, file lists, and scrolling never open a session or expose a preview.
- Unopened sessions expire after 24 hours by default. A viewing session lasts
  at most 5 minutes. After every session ends or expires, the server keeps the
  file for 1 more hour by default. Operators configure these durations in TOML.
  Each file keeps the durations in effect when it was sent.
- Original recipients can request permanent access, cancel that request, and
  see their own request state. Requests do not extend retention. The sender
  sees the request count and requester names in pills under that attachment.
- The sender's **Make permanent** action converts the entire file to an
  ordinary attachment. Current and future members with normal message access
  can then preview, reopen, and download it. No request is required.
- The first conversion by each sender in each channel or DM explains its
  effect. Acknowledgement persists across devices and after Undo. Later
  conversions take one click.
- A conversion shows **Attachment made permanent. Undo** for 15 seconds. Undo
  restores the original audience, consumed sessions, and expiry deadlines.
  Undo cannot recall bytes already received. If the original recovery deadline
  passed during conversion, Undo ends access immediately.
- Burn views have no application Download or Copy Image action. Their URLs
  remain bound to the account and the active session. HTTP checks protect
  cached transforms, originals, thumbnails, and video derivatives. S3-backed
  burn views stream through Chatto so a storage redirect cannot bypass expiry.
  A permanent conversion also streams through Chatto during its Undo period.
- Expiry revokes access before physical deletion. A recoverable worker deletes
  the active source, derivative files, and cached transforms. Screenshots,
  recipient-saved copies, backups, and object-store versions are outside this
  deletion boundary. Restoring an older backup restores its recorded session
  history; absolute expiry dates are not reset.

### Design Decisions

1. **One session per account.** Every original member can read the attachment
   once without consuming someone else's opportunity. Frozen membership avoids
   exposing it to people who join later. The cost is retaining it until the
   final original session ends or expires.
2. **Make permanent describes the result.** Conversion changes normal access
   for the whole attachment. A first-use explanation and short Undo period make
   the fast action clear. Copies received during that period cannot be revoked.
3. **Recovery follows the last original session.** A fixed recovery deadline
   gives the sender time to approve a request without indefinite retention.
