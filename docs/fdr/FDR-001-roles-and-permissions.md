# FDR-001: Roles & Permissions (RBAC)

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-09-28

## Overview

Chatto controls who can do what through role-based access control. Every authenticated human user holds one or more roles; each role grants or denies specific permissions. Permissions can also be overridden per room-group and per room, giving operators fine-grained control without inventing parallel role systems. Bot accounts are the deliberate exception: they use an explicit direct-permission allowlist bounded by their human owner's current authority (FDR-038).

Role metadata and member role lists update through realtime events. Display
changes do not reload the full client. Permission changes refresh affected data
in place for every user, including non-owners. The server shell and permitted
pages stay visible and mounted, so filters, drafts, and scroll positions remain
intact. Input is blocked during the authority check. Revoked access removes
the affected data or page; failed checks clear only the data they could not
reauthorize. Older reads and mutation results cannot restore that data.
Unrelated users keep their data.
A successful role creation or deletion can
still navigate after this cleanup, provided the user has not left the page or
changed session. This separates privacy cleanup from request completion
(ADR-062).

## Account Room Membership

Role and account permission matrices show only channels that are not archived.
Server, DM, and group columns remain available, including empty groups.
Archiving preserves permissions and membership. Unarchiving restores the channel
column with its existing permissions on the next matrix fetch.

The account permission matrix has a **Joined** row for human and bot accounts.
A confirmation dialog explains that the membership change takes effect
immediately after confirmation. Cancel leaves membership unchanged.
Configured permission grants stay unchanged.
`user.manage-accounts` or `room.manage` for the room can add an account without
its `room.join` permission. This lets a room manager invite a user who cannot
join independently. These permissions also authorize removal after join
permission is lost. Archived channels have no column in this matrix.

Bot owners and human bot managers can manage their bots without `room.manage`.
Without an account or room management override, adding a bot requires its
effective `room.join`, including its owner's ceiling. Suspensions and archived rooms
prevent adding. Universal membership remains automatic; DMs are excluded.
The event log records the acting manager and target account for each change,
including management overrides. Membership does not grant message permissions.
See [FDR-038](FDR-038-bot-accounts.md).

## Permission Help

Each row of a role or account permission matrix has an information button after
the permission name. The button opens a dialog. In narrow touch windows, the
dialog opens as a bottom sheet, so touch users can read the help too. The dialog
shows:

- the short description and a longer explanation of the permission;
- the category and the scopes where the permission can be set;
- whether the permission needs privileged mode;
- the permissions that it includes, and the permissions that include it.

A related permission is a button that shows the help for that permission. The
**Joined** row has its own dialog that explains membership. A permission from a
newer server shows only its identifier and category.

The frontend copies scopes, inclusions, and privileged-mode requirements from
the backend permission catalog. Update both catalogs together.

## Behavior

- Role and account permission reads use bounded scope pages or an exact scope
  filter. Each scope includes its applicable decisions, with inheritance from
  broader scopes even when those scopes are outside the page. The editors load
  more columns at the horizontal scroll edge. This bounds each calculation
  while allowing large servers to expose their full configuration.

- Role details and assigned members are separate reads. Member lists load in
  bounded pages so large roles do not require every user profile at once.
  Roster access requires `role.assign`, not access to the full administrative
  user directory. Only explicit assignments appear; `everyone` has no roster.
  Pages reflect current assignments, so concurrent changes can shift offsets.

- Every authenticated human user belongs to the implicit `everyone` role and may additionally hold one or more named roles. Bots inherit neither `everyone` nor named-role permissions.
- The system roles are `owner`, `admin`, `moderator`, `everyone`. Role position controls ordering/display and legacy event compatibility; it is not an authorization rank.
- A role grants or denies named permissions like `message.post`, `room.create`, `admin.view-users`.
- A permission identifier is an opaque, stable value. Current identifiers use
  punctuation to help developers recognize them, but punctuation does not
  define authority. The permission catalog defines inclusion explicitly.
- Permission grants and denies can be configured at Server, Direct messages,
  Room group, and Room scope. Channel checks use Room, Room group, then Server.
  DM checks use Direct messages, then Server. Each direct user or named role
  contributes its nearest decision. Denies win across those explicit subjects.
- Permissions gate capabilities and channel-room message access. Channel-room
  membership is necessary for message reads. `message.read` supplies broad
  read authority and includes `message.read-interactions`, which
  supplies authority for related threads only. The same read rules apply in
  DMs after the membership check. `message.post` separately
  gates root-message posting and permits human users to start DMs. Bot accounts
  cannot start DMs regardless of their permissions.
- Server admins can drag-and-drop to reorder custom roles. System role positions are fixed for ordering consistency.
- Custom role display names are limited to 80 bytes; descriptions are limited to 500 bytes.
- Owners are always entitled to all permissions. The owner override becomes effective only while the human session has privileged mode active. Without it, an owner resolves through direct grants, other roles, and `everyone` like any other user. An effective owner has the durable `owner` role; verified users listed in `owners.emails` in `chatto.toml` are materialized into that role at boot or through retryable durable work after verification.
- `admin` and every other non-owner role confer only their explicit permission decisions; they have no role-name-based authority.
- Owner permissions are virtual rather than persisted defaults: fresh servers do not seed editable owner permission rows, and the admin UI shows owner permissions as read-only green checks.
- RBAC editor and inspection APIs are exposed through ConnectRPC admin services. Admin entry is authenticated, and individual operations keep narrower gates such as `role.manage`, `role.assign`, `user.manage-accounts`, `user.manage-permissions`, or `room.manage`.
- Delegated role assignment is bounded by the assigner's own authority. A non-owner may assign a role only when they effectively possess every permission that role explicitly allows at the same scope, and may revoke it only when they have authority over all of its explicit allow and deny decisions. Only an effective owner may assign or revoke the `owner` role.
- Default permissions are creation-time state: fresh server defaults are seeded only into an empty RBAC stream, and channel-room defaults are committed atomically with room creation. Startup does not backfill missing or cleared decisions.
- Roles have a `pingable` setting that controls whether `@role` pings notify assigned room members. Fresh servers seed `moderator` as pingable and leave `owner`, `admin`, and `everyone` unpingable.
- User-initiated RBAC writes carry the authenticated user's ID as the event actor. Synthetic `system` actors are reserved for bootstrap, seeding, migrations, and other non-user maintenance.
- Losing effective room visibility through membership, room-group layout, or
  RBAC removes inaccessible notification occurrences. A durable visibility
  boundary prevents activity queued before that loss from becoming visible if
  access is quickly regained.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Flat, single-tier role layout

**Decision:** One server-wide role layer. No separate "instance roles" vs "space roles".
**Why:** The earlier two-tier split duplicated concepts and made permission resolution unpredictable. Collapsing into one tier with per-room-group / per-room overrides gives equivalent flexibility with one mental model. See ADR-027 and ADR-030.
**Tradeoff:** Operators who liked per-space role ownership now configure that through room-group overrides instead.

### 2. Named subjects with an `everyone` baseline

**Decision:** For non-owner human users, select the nearest room/group/server decision independently for the direct user and every explicitly assigned named role. Denies win across those decisions. Select `everyone`'s nearest decision as the scoped baseline; a direct-user or named-role allow overrides an `everyone` deny only at the same or a nearer scope. If nothing applies, the result is denied at the API boundary. Bots instead use only explicit direct-user allows, further bounded by their owner's current RBAC entitlement.
**Why:** Operators can express an allowlist by denying the `everyone` baseline and granting a named role, while a named restriction role such as `suspended` still reliably denies. Role position remains irrelevant to authorization. See ADR-052.
**Tradeoff:** An `everyone` deny can be overridden deliberately at its own scope or a nearer one. A restriction role's deny beats other subjects' grants, but a nearer allow configured on that same role replaces its broader deny. Direct-user decisions follow the same nearest-scope rule. ADR-052 records the compatibility audit.

### 3. Four permission scopes

**Decision:** For each subject, channel checks use the nearest decision at Room,
Room group, or Server scope. DM checks use the nearest decision at Direct
messages or Server scope. All `message.*` permissions apply to Direct messages.
No `room.*` permission applies there. Fresh servers store no Direct messages
decision, so human users inherit Server decisions. Bots need an explicit
direct-user allow at the applicable scope. The effective `message.read` allow
includes `message.read-interactions`; bootstrap does not store a second grant.
**Why:** Operators need system-wide defaults, channel overrides, and a DM-only
policy for integrations without one permission object for each DM. See ADR-031,
ADR-052, and ADR-091.
**Tradeoff:** Scope precedence is per subject, not global: one role's room allow does not erase a different named role's deny.

### 4. Owners are effective-owner overrides

**Decision:** Owners are always entitled to all permissions. Owner role permission rows are not seeded on fresh servers and are not editable through the RBAC UI/API. Privileged mode gates the complete owner override at request time (ADR-105).
**Why:** Instance owners must not be able to lock themselves out through unusual role or per-user permission configuration. Activation depends only on entitlement, so the gate does not lock owners out. See ADR-040.
**Tradeoff:** RBAC cannot be used to restrict owners, and owner permissions appear as virtual read-only allows rather than stored permission decisions. Restricting owner access requires changing ownership configuration or account state.

### 5. Config-designated owners converge on the durable role

**Decision:** `owners.emails` is materialized as durable `owner` role assignments. Existing verified matches are repaired at boot; a new matching verification is processed by a retryable durable worker and waits for that source fact before returning. Permission checks use only the durable role, and the role cannot be revoked while the matching verified email remains configured.
**Why:** One durable representation keeps live authorization, current
notification visibility, and recovery behavior consistent. A transient role
append failure remains pending for redelivery instead of creating a live-only
owner that notification cleanup cannot recognize.
**Tradeoff:** A transient materialization failure can delay completion of email verification. Removing an email from `owners.emails` does not automatically revoke an already materialized owner role, because the server cannot distinguish config-created assignments from manual ones; operators may revoke it after updating configuration.

### 6. Target-user mutations are permission-gated and role assignment is bounded

**Decision:** Mutations that target another user require concrete permissions, not actor-vs-target rank checks. Role assignment uses `role.assign`, but a non-owner may assign only roles whose explicit allows they themselves effectively hold at each exact scope. Revocation is also bounded by every explicit allow and deny on the role, because removing a deny can restore authority. The `owner` role remains owner-only; `admin` has no implicit authority outside its explicit permissions. Account lifecycle and recovery operations use `user.manage-accounts`; direct user permission overrides use `user.manage-permissions`; moderated room removal uses `room.remove-member`.
**Why:** Concrete permissions are easier to audit and explain than a role-rank hierarchy, while bounding `role.assign` prevents delegated role managers from granting authority they do not possess or removing restrictions they cannot control.
**Tradeoff:** A delegated assigner may need the target role's underlying permissions even when they only administer membership. Owners remain the recovery path, and old replicas can enforce the earlier unbounded rule during a rolling upgrade until they are replaced.

### 7. RBAC state is event-sourced

**Decision:** Role definitions, role order, assignments, and explicit permission decisions are durable events, with reads served from an in-memory RBAC projection.
**Why:** This aligns RBAC with Chatto's current event-sourced architecture and makes authorization reads rebuildable from the deployment event log. See ADR-033 and ADR-035.
**Tradeoff:** Writes must append events and wait for local projection catch-up before returning, so mutation paths need optimistic concurrency handling instead of direct state writes. Authorization-sensitive commands validate stable request-time RBAC, room-group, and user inputs. Domain events use OCC on the aggregate or filter that owns the command invariant. A cross-aggregate revocation that occurs after the final authorization validation can overlap an already-authorized command.

User-triggered RBAC events are audit facts as well as state facts, so their event envelope actor is the user who performed the operation. Core APIs still accept `SystemActorID` for trusted non-user paths such as bootstrapping default roles and permissions.

### 8. Permission-decision events carry typed scope and subject

**Decision:** Permission grant/deny/clear events store `scope` as `{kind, id}` (`SERVER`, `GROUP`, `ROOM`) and `subject` as `{kind, id}` (`ROLE`, `USER`).
**Why:** The old flattened fields made role/user permission subjects indistinguishable and relied on string conventions for scope. The typed shape freezes the domain model before beta and prevents future role IDs from colliding with user IDs.
**Tradeoff:** Event constructors do a little more validation, and compatibility readers for older persisted event shapes have to infer subject kind from legacy wire fields.

### 9. Defaults are one-time initialization, not startup policy

**Decision:** Apply the current server default set only when the durable RBAC stream is empty. New groups and ordinary rooms store no default decisions. Commit a channel room and any exceptional default decisions in one atomic EVT batch: fresh announcements rooms deny `message.post` to `everyone` and allow it for `admin`. Do not reset existing permission state during startup. The introduction of
call permissions has one explicit upgrade exception: initialize each missing
server-level `everyone` call permission once. Any historical grant, deny, or
clear prevents that initialization. This preserves the existing human call
feature without undoing an operator's later decision.
**Why:** Absence is a meaningful RBAC state. Reapplying code defaults on every startup makes an operator's explicit clear indistinguishable from incomplete bootstrap state.
**Tradeoff:** Apart from the explicit call-permission upgrade above, adding a new code default does not grant it to existing servers or rooms automatically. Older replicas in a rolling deployment still use their historical non-atomic room-creation path until they are replaced.

### 10. The permission catalog defines inclusion

**Decision:** Treat permission identifiers as opaque, stable values. Use
`domain.capability` or `domain.capability-with-qualifier` for current names.
Define each inclusion directly in the permission catalog. The catalog states
that `message.read` includes `message.read-interactions`. The narrow permission
does not include the broad permission. A narrow deny cannot restrict an
effective broad allow, and a broad deny cannot restrict a separate narrow
allow. Inclusion changes effective authorization only and does not store an
additional grant. Catalog validation rejects unknown targets, self-inclusion,
and relationships with incompatible categories or scopes. Public APIs and EVT
facts use the stable identifier.
**Why:** Authorization must not change because a developer chose punctuation
for a new identifier. Explicit metadata keeps inclusion reviewable while stable
identifiers preserve persisted facts and integrations.
**Tradeoff:** The backend and frontend catalogs must keep their explicit
relationships in sync. Tests cover the current relationship.

## Permissions

- `call.start`, `call.join`, `call.voice`, `call.camera`, and `call.screenshare`
  separate starting, joining, and publishing media. Room membership remains
  mandatory. These permissions apply to rooms and the shared Direct messages
  scope. See [FDR-016](FDR-016-voice-calls.md).

The full permission catalog is in `cli/internal/core/permission.go`. Key permissions that gate RBAC management itself:

- `role.manage` — configure role definitions and the permissions attached to them.
- `role.assign` — assign or revoke roles, bounded for non-owners by the target role's explicit scoped permission decisions.
- `user.manage-accounts` — create users, edit account identity, reset passwords, attach verified emails, clear login cooldowns, and bypass the holder's own login cooldown.
- `user.manage-permissions` — edit direct per-user permission overrides.
- `admin.view-users`, `admin.view-audit` — gate specific admin UI sub-views; admin UI entry is derived from concrete capabilities rather than a standalone `admin.access` permission. System diagnostics are owner-only and exposed through a viewer capability, not through grantable RBAC.
- `message.read` — read message content and message-specific metadata in
  channel rooms and DMs. Fresh servers grant this to `everyone` at server scope.
  Existing servers are not backfilled or reconciled, so operators must add any
  wanted grants during upgrade.
- `message.read-interactions` — read only threads that the account
  started or where another account directly mentioned it. A relationship gives
  access to the complete thread. An effective `message.read` allow includes
  this permission. Fresh servers store only the `message.read` grant for
  `everyone`. Existing servers are not backfilled or reconciled.
- `message.post` — post root messages and thread replies, and let human users start DMs.
  Includes `message.post-in-thread` and `message.post-in-interactions`. A narrow
  deny cannot restrict an effective broad allow.
  Bot accounts cannot start DMs. Fresh servers grant this permission to
  `everyone` at server scope. Fresh announcement rooms replace that baseline
  with a room-level `everyone` deny and a room-level `admin` allow. Moderators
  and other named roles need their own room-level posting grant.
- `message.post-in-thread` — reply in any readable thread where room policy permits it.
- `message.post-in-interactions` — reply in readable threads with an interaction relationship. In a received DM, also send normal messages with current membership and read access. This permission does not permit starting DMs or posting channel roots.
- `message.attach` — attach files to new messages. Fresh servers grant this to `everyone` at server scope; existing servers are not automatically backfilled after upgrade, so operators may need to grant it manually if uploads should remain enabled.
- `room.manage` — edit/configure/delete channel rooms.
- `room.remove-member` — remove current channel-room members with an optional suspension. DM membership is not managed through this permission.
